<p>Breaker panels and fuse box panels are complex and delicate, and it's never a good idea to try and DIY your breaker panel upgrade or replacement.

The bulb's intense heat can scorch or melt the socket and insulation on the fixture's wires, which increases the risk of arcing — sparks that jump through the air from one wire to another — a chief cause of electrical fires.</p>
<p>When using extension cords for outside use, make sure that the extension cords are rated for outdoor use and ensure the connections are shielded from the weather. For the most part, they are used in applications such as commercial parking garage lighting, warehouse lighting, and certain outdoor applications such as security flood lighting. Another popular trend in outdoor lighting is small lights that are clustered together and hidden in plants.

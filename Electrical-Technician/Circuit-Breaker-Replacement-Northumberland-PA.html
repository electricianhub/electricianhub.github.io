<p>As with all machinery, parts wear and tear over time due to years of use and accidents. Wires connect to the transformer and stretch out along the ground to attach to each light fixture. Inside the sheathing are at least two thermoplastic insulated wires of the same gauge, though different cables can have different gauges. You may be tempted to shove the wires into the box, but care and precision are important here. Putting it straight, the whole house surge protector shields your home's appliances from getting damaged due to surplus electricity flow.</p>

More than 2,000 children are in emergency rooms due to electrical burns or shocks each year. For example, let's say you have a circuit with wiring rated to handle 15 amps. Adding an additional fixture to a low voltage system is relatively easy, so long as there's enough power coming from the transformer to power the light.

<p>It is important to plan ahead when installing low voltage lighting so that you can avoid any potential problems, especially with the setup. Tell children that electric cords should be left alone.

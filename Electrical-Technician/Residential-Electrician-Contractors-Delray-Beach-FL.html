If the outlets ARE half hot, with one half of it switched, it will not be possible to reproduce that with the new outlets.</p>

These types of boxes are a heck of a lot easier to install before the drywall is up, so even if there's a small chance that you'll replace the light with a fan sometime down the road, avoid headaches and spend a couple extra bucks on a fan box.</p>

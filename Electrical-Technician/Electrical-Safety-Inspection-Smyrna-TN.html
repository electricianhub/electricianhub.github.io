<p>Power outages can happen unexpectedly for a variety of different reasons. You can't even get fuses for many fuse boxes anymore. But if the GFCI is recording a fault, then troubleshooting is required to find the loose wire, bad connection, defective electrical device, melted motor winding etc. In general, electricians say you can handle installing receptacles, outlets and lighting fixtures as a DIY job if you have a clear idea what you're doing, but more complex work requires expert help. The only difference is that the wires are insulated and covered by a flexible spiral made from aluminum or steel.</p>

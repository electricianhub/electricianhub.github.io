<p>Standby generators are what you choose when you don't even want to know that a power outage is occurring. 3.Circuits can be added for future power needs due to proposed home renovations.

<p>Standby generators - A standby generator is permanently installed outside your home, and usually runs on propane or natural gas. The electrical panel box is usually installed alongside the electric meter.

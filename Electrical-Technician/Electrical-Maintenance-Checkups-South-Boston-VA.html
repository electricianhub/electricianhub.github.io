<p>A limited electrical contractor will require a Montana licensed journeyman electrician as the responsible party and limits the electrical work to residential construction consisting of less than five living units in a single structure. However, you may be able to shorten your apprenticeship by getting credit for some of the classroom hours from your pre-apprenticeship program. And even if you do, your employer may not want you to practice troubleshooting on equipment they depend on. Until you become reasonably competent, it is best to practice troubleshooting in a controlled environment.</p>
<p>This is one of the reasons you don't just want a surge protector at the circuit panel A layered system will be connected directly to the electrical panel and at the point of use. Unless your outlets are switched, with a switch somewhere in the kitchen, (that would be very unusual), each outlet appears to have 2 circuits going to it. Verify this if possible, by turning off the breakers. Turn the power back on and make sure that the outlet works properly by plugging in a lamp and checking to see that the light switch turns the lamp on and off.</p>
<p>Especially appliances that use up a lot of energy and electricity, your panel works just as hard to keep up with them. If you need to replace the dangerous Federal Pacific Electric panels, Zinsco panels, or any other outdated electrical panel, we've got the electrician for you.

<p>Some apprenticeship programs will take formal education into account and apply academic credits to classroom hours. Load side transformer wires tend to be the same color and only connections from the transformer to the main are different insulation colors to denote the hot from the neutral wire. Whereas a portable generator can only run a few of your electrical devices, a standby generator has enough juice to power your entire home - this includes your lights, appliances, and even entertainment devices.</p>

Portable models cost less than standby models, typically around $500 to $1,500, but they can only operate a few appliances at once. Do not sit on the cabinets housing electrical equipment.

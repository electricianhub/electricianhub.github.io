While you may be familiar with the external circuit breakers on your service panel, there is a whole host of wiring and other components behind those circuit breakers that sometimes require repair and replacement.</p>
<p>It sounds like the entire outlet is switched, but with a red wire there I would suspect that there is a black wire somewhere back in the box, likely feeding other outlets. Furthermore, NEC Sections 411.5(A) and 250.22(4) do not permit the secondary of a low-voltage lighting system transformer to be grounded for any reason. When the low-voltage lighting system is being installed in permanent cabinets with a remote power source connected to fixed wiring, these products are required to comply with UL 2108 for low-voltage incandescent luminaires and luminaire fittings.</p>

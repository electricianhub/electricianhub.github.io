Place the voltmeter probes on the hot side of the line fuses as shown at position A. A line voltage reading tells you that your voltmeter is operational and that you have voltage to the source side of the line fuses L1-L2.</p>
<p>Having a generator is useful in a variety of capacities—especially when you need to rely on backup power or require a secondary power source. This can also happen if you mistakenly attempt to work on your electrical system without first shutting off the power. Otherwise I would have had to upgrade by service panel. Then you will use a similar item known as a Quick Connector to fasten the laid-out cable to each light fixture. And also, for your safety, throw off the master switch for the fuse box, just to be sure you don't get shocked when putting in the new one.</p>

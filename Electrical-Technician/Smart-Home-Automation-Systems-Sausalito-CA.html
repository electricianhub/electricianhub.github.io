<p>Most single-pole switches will have two black wires connected to the switch — one will serve as the "hot" wire, bringing power to the switch, and the other is the "load" wire, sending power out to the light. Circuit breakers stop circuits from becoming overloaded and starting fires. Wiremen are generally trained in one of five primary specialties: commercial, residential, light industrial, industrial, and low-voltage wiring, more commonly known as Voice-Data-Video, or VDV.</p>

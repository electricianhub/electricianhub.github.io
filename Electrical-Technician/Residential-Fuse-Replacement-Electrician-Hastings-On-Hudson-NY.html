It's also worth considering the placement of light switches if family members are getting older or have lost mobility and would have trouble reaching a switch while seated in a wheelchair. A digital timer may be used for more complex lighting systems where multiple start times are required including start times on different days of the week.</p>
<p>After completing an apprenticeship program, electricians are considered to be journey workers and may perform duties on their own, subject to any local licensing requirements.

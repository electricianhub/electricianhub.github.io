<p>Residential electrician licenses are issued by the Board. But it is also very important that you are aware of the limitations these protectors come with. This makes them much more common for large-scale outdoor projects, including landscape lighting projects. Indoor reduced voltage lighting is also very affordable and convenient to use. If you can't get the transformer close enough to your light fixtures you will need to up the voltage that your line carries. Worn cords and damaged plugs increase your risk of both fires and electrical shocks.</p>
<p>Although they all may look the same when installed, the various light switches function in different ways and are wired differently. You can double check to ensure that it was turned off by flipping the switch in an attempt to operate a light, and by using a voltage tester once the switch plate is removed to confirm that the wires are not charged. The existing electrical panel is in code violation and moving the panel is simply the easiest way to solve the problem.</p>

The outgoing hot or black wire (red arrow, above left in our photo) connects to the terminal marked "Load" or "Charge" and "Black" or "Noir". There is over 100 years of installed fixtures. The generator continues producing power while stopping and your houses electrical load drains the magnetic field of the coils.

<p>Signs of Electrical Fires: Electrical fires within your panel tend to burn out quickly on their own, but this doesn't mean they should be neglected. Just like with a car or truck, your backup generator is an investment that needs to be serviced and maintained properly.

If the outlets ARE half hot, with one half of it switched, it will not be possible to reproduce that with the new outlets.</p>

For example, a single-pole switch requiring no rewiring will cost about $75, while a smart switch requiring new wiring may cost as much as $250. Because an electrical problem detected in its infancy typically allows companies a larger window of time to schedule repair before the problem gets worse, scans makes it easier to schedule repairs in terms of both cost planning and weekly business scheduling.</p>

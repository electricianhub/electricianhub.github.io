<h2>How To Hire Residential Electrician in Waukesha</h2>
<p>Siemens is committed to providing high quality surge protective devices for application in residential, commercial, and industrial electrical systems. By utilizing general maintenance on home and business electrical systems, customers can potentially decrease their need for emergency services. Upgrading an electrical service adds value to the home and in some cases, can lower homeowner's insurance premiums.

When a surge protective device senses a transient voltage spike, it uses internal components called Metal Oxide Varistors (MOVs) that act like magnets for the excess voltage, and sends it to the load center's ground wire before it can reach your home's connected electronics.</p>

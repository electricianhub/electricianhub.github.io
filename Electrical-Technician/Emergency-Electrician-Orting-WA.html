Mersen's UL Surge Protective Devices (SPDs) provide critical protection to ensure public safety and well-being. But if you know the kind of work these two types of electricians do, and you know the right questions to ask, you'll be able to find a skilled and knowledgeable electrician for any job you need to be completed. Replacing an outlet is a quick job for a licensed electrician, so it's worth having one do it right.

There were a couple of other what the heck did they do here??!” boxes, and so I asked the electrician to change them out after installing can lights in one of the rooms.</p>

Then, disconnect the wires from the starter coil, connect a voltmeter to the coil, and energize and operate the control circuit to determine if voltage is reaching the coil, thus eliminating the possibility of trouble being in the coil itself.</p>
<p>Solar outdoor lights are probably the most popular type of outdoor lighting available on the market. If necessary, cut the sod around the light fixtures with the shovel.

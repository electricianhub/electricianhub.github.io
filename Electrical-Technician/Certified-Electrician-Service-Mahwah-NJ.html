<p>I have a few tips for keeping your landscape lighting wires safe, one tip I'll show you, most do it yourselfers would never think of.

<p>You know- when you have branched wiring and are using high voltage power cords and extension cords. Surge suppressors have a certain response time which they react to stabilize excess voltage.

With your insulated pliers, pull the switch out of the electrical box making sure to keep your hands and tools well clear of the terminals.</p>

<p>A plus for running propane over NG is that you will get the full 20KW out of the genset rather than a 20% reduction (e.g. 18KW) using NG. I think that is one of the reasons why Generac came out with the 22KW unit, even though it uses the same two cylinder engine in order to pump up the NG output. Breakers Won't Remain Reset: If you notice that a reset circuit breaker in your electrical panel won't stay reset or restore power, then it's very likely that you have a faulty service panel.</p>

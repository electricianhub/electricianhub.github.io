<p>If you live in an older home, you may have outlets that don't have a third or grounded” hole.

In addition to the importance of proper installation, undergoing regular generator maintenance is incredibly important for homeowners and businesses who want their generator to last as long as possible and operate as efficiently as possible.</p>

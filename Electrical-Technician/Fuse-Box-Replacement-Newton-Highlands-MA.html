In addition, although building lights, receptacles, or other line-voltage devices in the building may be switched on- and off- by low voltage wiring switches and relays, those lights, receptacles, or other devices themselves may require line voltage to operate. Most landscape lighting today is low voltage, and with good reason. As we mentioned, the older your home is, the more likely you are to need an electrical panel upgrade.</p>

<p>Flickering lights or lighting connections stop working despite how many new bulbs you try can be an indicator of other electrical problems, so it is important to address these issues as soon as possible to ensure your safety. With a whole home generator installed by our pros at Cardinal Heating & Air Conditioning, you never have to worry about losing power. Not only do fuse boxes create additional safety concerns, but they could be a reason that home insurance companies refuse to cover your home (or pay out if you do get coverage). When issues arise with your generator, it is best to rely on a licensed electrician who has an in-depth knowledge of these systems.

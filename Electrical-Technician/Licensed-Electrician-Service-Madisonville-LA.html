Sophisticated lighting schemes call for more switches. We offer a wide variety of electrical repairs such as: ceiling fan repairs, electrical troubelshooting, lighting repairs, outlet repairs, switch repairs, GFCI outlet repairs, GFCI breaker repairs and more.

<p>The advantages of halogen are the cost of the fixtures (they are one of the cheapest), and the quality of light. If you notice lights dimming or flickering when a large appliance kicks on, that means they're on the same circuit and the appliance takes electrical current away from the lights when it turns on. Unscrew the switch from the electrical box and pull it out with the wires still attached. These two components work together to maintain constant electrical power for a home or business when there is an outage.</p>

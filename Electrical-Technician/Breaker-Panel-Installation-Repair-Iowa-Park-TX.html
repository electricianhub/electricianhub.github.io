<p>Electrical safety needs to be taught to children early on. Safety plugs should be inserted in unused outlets when toddlers are in the home. For example, when an outlet is not working, they may use a multimeter to check the voltage, amperage, or resistance to determine the best course of action. Perform basic circuit checks for shorts, opens and ground faults using a multimeter. The most valid point of this article is that always have electrical work done by qualified electricians and not by handy men or some guy working on the side.</p>
<p>Put safety plugs over all electrical outlets to prevent children from sticking screwdrivers, nails, pins, or other metal objects into them.

Another helpful thing you can do is install surge protectors. Even if you were to upgrade your electrical panel on your own, that in and of itself won't increase the power supply to your home.</p>

For as long as the surge voltage lasts, the semiconductor channels harmful current to ground. Ambient light from the spotlights you do use can also illuminate and create an interplay of light and shadow of nearby plants and foliage.

<p>Tape the white wire at both ends of the switch circuit with black tape so that the next worker knows that this is a switch circuit and that the white wire is not a neutral wire.

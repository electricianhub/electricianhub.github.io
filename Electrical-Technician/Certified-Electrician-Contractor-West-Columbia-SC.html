With the correct installation, you can rest assured that you will have the best lighting fixtures installed for you and your family. Plus, a bad electrical panel can be extremely dangerous.</p>
<p>Most single-pole switches will have two black wires connected to the switch — one will serve as the "hot" wire, bringing power to the switch, and the other is the "load" wire, sending power out to the light.

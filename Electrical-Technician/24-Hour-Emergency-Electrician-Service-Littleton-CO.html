You can double check to ensure that it was turned off by flipping the switch in an attempt to operate a light, and by using a voltage tester once the switch plate is removed to confirm that the wires are not charged. The existing electrical panel is in code violation and moving the panel is simply the easiest way to solve the problem.</p>

<p>Moreover, upgrading an electric panel makes financial sense when factoring in issues with homeowners insurance and safety concerns without outdated equipment.

The unit can power several high-demand appliances simultaneously, including HVAC units, electric ovens, and washer and dryers.</p>

If the power goes out, an electronic switch automatically signals the unit to turn on, keeping essential household systems and appliances running even if you're miles away.</p>
<p>If LEDs seem appealing to you, consider shopping for lights which offer a warmer color spectrum. Moreover, sufficient egress lighting must be installed at exit accesses, exits, and exit discharges. So no matter what size covers you need to use - tall, deep, jumbo, narrow, short - your switches will always fit the openings and screw holes on your wall plates. It's for this reason, among others, that electrical maintenance is such an important part of commercial building operations.</p>

<p>If you've ever walked into a home where the ceiling fan is hanging or separated from the ceiling and ever wondered what was causing the problem, you're about to find out. Voltage is a measure of a difference in electric potential energy.

<p>One of the first decisions you'll have to make it whether you want lights that are solar-powered or wired for electricity. Loop the far end of the wire back to the transformer to ensure both ends of the loop are powered, which also prevents the lights from going out if the wire is broken somewhere along its length, McGowan adds.

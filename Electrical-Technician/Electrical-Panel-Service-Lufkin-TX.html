<h3>Principles of Lightning and Surge Protection in Lufkin TX</h3>
<p>A good way to try this is to run string or twine from the location of your transformer (by your GFCI outlet) to the fixtures.

A slightly larger "cover plate", supplied with the wall-plate, or additional to it, then clips over the assembly, as an additional insulating barrier covering the deep set wall-plate mounting screws - which are "deep set" to prevent inadvertent human contact.</p>

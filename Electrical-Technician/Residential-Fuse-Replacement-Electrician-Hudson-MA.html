<p>The voltage reading at the hub must reflect the same reading for all lights in the group. Since your breaker panel is essentially the nervous system of your home, it's important to keep up with the maintenance and ensure that everything is working properly. But understanding the basics of your home electrical wiring doesn't have to be so intensive. Nothing you do with the white wires will do anything to provide power to the upper half of that outlet - it requires a black wire.</p>

With professionally installed landscape lighting system you'll get the maximum effect for your money, and the satisfaction will last for years. A landscape lighting professional can show you all of the possibilities and deliver the best, most efficient lighting to bring your home to life. Look over your main electrical panel and the area surrounding it. You should have three feet of clear space around the panel, and an easy-to-find, battery-operated light source available for when the power goes out.</p>
<p>A licensed electrician can check your electrical panel, tighten any wires that need it, and even use an infrared tester to identify which circuit breakers are getting too hot in the fuse box. To be up to code and ensure you're not potentially endangering power workers, you should run the generator into a power transfer switch. The American Red Cross recommends permanently installed backup generators as a safer way to provide backup power to a home than a portable generator.</p>

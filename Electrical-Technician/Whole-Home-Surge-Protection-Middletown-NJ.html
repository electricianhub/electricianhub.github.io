The electrical wiring in a home service panel can be confusing when taking the DIY approach, and an improperly installed device could result in defects or danger to those installing it. The home surge protector may not function properly if not installed correctly and at worse, could cause more damage.

The front of the house isn't the only place to use landscape lights. Outlets will need to meet or exceed your local electrical codes to ensure the safety of your home and family.

The power supply cannot be installed in a concealed location behind drywall or where access is rendered inaccessible without damaging or destroying the building finish.</p>

<h3>Lightning Damages and Protection Practices in Independence KY</h3>
<p>Electrical installing work must be carried out by a licensed electrical contractor, who in turn must employ licensed electricians.

<p>A plus for running propane over NG is that you will get the full 20KW out of the genset rather than a 20% reduction (e.g. 18KW) using NG.

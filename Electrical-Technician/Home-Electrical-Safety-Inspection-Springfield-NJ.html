Lock out or tag all electrical equipment or lines while they are being serviced, maintained or adjusted. They can also work in a factory, overseeing the production and the manufacturing of consumer electronics and other electrical equipment. However, if you are sure you need even more power then there are portable generators with 12,000 or even 15,000 (15 kw) running watts.</p>
<p>If you haven't updated your home's electrical system in a long time, or if you detect any of these warning signs, you should contact a licensed residential electrician to inspect the service panel and service it accordingly.

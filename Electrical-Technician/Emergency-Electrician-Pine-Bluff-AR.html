<p>In today's world we rely on all kinds of sophisticated electronic equipment; not only for our entertainment, but to fulfill the basic needs of our daily lives. However, surge protective panels or strips alone are not enough to fight damaging power surges. Finding out that your standby generator isn't working after a storm or power outage is too late. For example, if each light is 5 watts and you have 10 lights, your total wattage is 50. You want a transformer that is 20% larger than what you need. Attach the loose end of the new wire to the silver screw on the new outlet. Uncover the ends of the cable wire close to the transformer and connect them to the transformer's terminals.</p>
<p>Hire a competent electrician or other qualified person to plan and install new circuits. A certified electrician has the education, training and experience to get the job done correctly, ensuring the safety of your business, home, and loved ones. Can lighting, recessed lights, track lighting, sidewalk lights, in-ground lighting, outdoor solar lights, colored LED lighting, and chandeliers are the most common. If you have a meter based surge protector which was installed by Pioneer Electric, it will be removed within 60-90 days.</p>

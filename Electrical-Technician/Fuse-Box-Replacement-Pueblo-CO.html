It wouldn't be a bad idea to familiarize your family with these electrical wires. Generally, we are well and safe as long as the proper electrical safety mechanisms such as fuses, circuit breakers, etc are in place and we stay vigilant (not foolhardy) when working around electricity and electrical applicances.</p>

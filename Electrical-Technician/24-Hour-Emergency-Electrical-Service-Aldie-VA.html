The electrical wiring in a home service panel can be confusing when taking the DIY approach, and an improperly installed device could result in defects or danger to those installing it. The home surge protector may not function properly if not installed correctly and at worse, could cause more damage.

<p>A power surge is a rush of high-voltage electricity that can cause harm to electrical, electromechanical and electronic equipment. Industrial electricians are basically commercial electricians who primarily work in factories, chemical plants, and mines, etc. Your Generac home backup generator safely delivers power right to your home's electrical panel.

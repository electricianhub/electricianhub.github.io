<p>With utility companies and electric cooperatives offering cost-sharing programs to reduce farmers out-of-pocket costs for the safe wiring of farms, the demand for knowledgeable and experienced farm electricians is growing. Class B Electrician: Must complete 3,000 hours of work in residential or farmstead wiring in 1 to 2-family dwellings under a Class B or Master electrician. Finally, as with all electrical or mechanical devices, wear and tear, age and the effects of the elements can create damage that requires repair or replacement. For some houses, an upgrade to copper electrical wiring may be necessary. Therefore if your "plug" (wall receptacle) is not working, the green screw and ground wire are not the problem.</p>

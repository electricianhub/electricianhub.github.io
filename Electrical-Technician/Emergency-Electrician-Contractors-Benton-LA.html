<p>Not only that, landscape lighting makes your property look more luxurious and expensive, leading to increased value. With the average lifespan of a home now greater than 35 years and technology's rapid rate of progression, the answer is likely no.

Upgrading older buildings, new construction for increased populations and new energy technologies will account for much of the job growth.</p>

Never place surge protectors or their power supply cords under a rug or someplace they could experience wear and tear from being stepped on. And don't staple or tack their power cords to anything.

If it was you have two circuits in each box and outlet, and very likely have 240 volts in the outlet boxes, which is OK but any such box (and outlet) needs labeled indicating that. This should also include any trees, garden decor, or special features of the landscaping Taking measurements will also help when it comes time to purchase the lighting fixtures, particularly if you are going to use low voltage lighting, because you need to have the right amount of cabling for the entire project.</p>

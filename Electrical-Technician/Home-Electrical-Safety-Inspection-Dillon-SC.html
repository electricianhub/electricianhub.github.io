Lightning protection systems exist; they work through the ground and over the home by using air terminals, conductor cables, and ground rods to prevent electricity from reaching and affecting the house.

<p>You can be sure that Dayton, Ohio Electrician is more then capable to handle any and all emergencies in a timely manner. Others feel that dated electrical services are unsafe and do not provide the same level of protection that newer designs offer. Several years ago I bought a 10 "circuit" transfer switch and had it installed for $500 total. The Line terminals (green arrows in photo at left) on an electrical receptacle are for the incoming hot wire - the terminal marked LINE is connected to the incoming power source or the "hot" wire (typically black or red in insulation color) that connects to the brass colored screw (marked "Black" or "Noir) at the lower left " in our photo.</p>

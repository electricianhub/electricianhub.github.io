In contrast, Lucifer Lighting and others point out that when selecting an electrical wire (conductor) size for the low-voltage devices such as downlights used indoors or outside, the wire needs to be chosen based also on the distance between the light fixture and the low voltage transformer.</p>

If any outlet emits a burning odor or sparks, shut down the electrical panel right away and call an electrician for help , as you could be at immediate risk for fire.

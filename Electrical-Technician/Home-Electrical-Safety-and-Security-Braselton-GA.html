<p>Sadly, some electrical service companies don't answer the phone after hours.

A breaker box or a fuse panel in need of repair or replacement is no exception to this. In the case of FPE, they lost their UL listing when it was discovered their breakers would not necessarily trip when they needed to.

Oftentimes, the light problem isn't from the light fixture itself, but from the light switch. Circuit breakers are contained within your electrical panel and their job is to protect the electrical circuits in your home or building by stopping the flow of electricity in the event of an overload, short-circuit, or other electrical fault.</p>

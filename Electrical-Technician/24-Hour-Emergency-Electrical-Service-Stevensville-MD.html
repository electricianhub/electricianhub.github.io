You can use your portable generator to power up your most vital appliances when your home loses electricity, for your home DIY projects, or even during a backyard BBQ. Some whole house generators come with a mounting pad or need a cement block to be placed upon.</p>
<p>Never work on electrical systems in the rain, or in damp or wet locations, or where power is not completely shut off. Sometimes a breaker might overheat to the point that the buss bar in a panel gets burned.

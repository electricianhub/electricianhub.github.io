<p>An automatic transfer switch is installed to switch power to the generator when utility power experiences an outage. Lightning may strike at any moment, causing a power surge that could damage or destroy your TV, personal computer and other everyday electrical appliances in your home. A service panel distributes electricity throughout a building.

<p>A lot of us keep a generator around for those occasions where some extra power might be warranted, but a home standby generator isn't just a little piece for handling a couple of extra rooms. Never place surge protectors or their power supply cords under a rug or someplace they could experience wear and tear from being stepped on. And don't staple or tack their power cords to anything.

Over time, the connections between electrical wires and switches or outlets can loosen Check to make sure that all outlet covers and switch plates are in good condition and that the wires inside are secure.</p>
<p>If necessary, loosen the screws a half-turn and align the switch-outlet vertically by hand, then tighten the screws. If any outlet emits a burning odor or sparks, shut down the electrical panel right away and call an electrician for help , as you could be at immediate risk for fire. If the surge protector worked TOO effectively, and siphoned away too much of the electric current then the appliance would not be able to work. For example, one circuit breaker may control the electricity to the bathroom, and one may control the outlets and lights in the living room.</p>

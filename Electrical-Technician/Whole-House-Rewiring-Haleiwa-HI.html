<p>For example, a 300-watt transformer can power 100 feet of 16-gauge cable, or 150 feet of 14-gauge cable, or 200 feet of 12-gauge cable. Power surges can happen to literally anybody and you want to be prepared when it happens to you. Choosing the right electrician for either a residential or commercial task is no small feat. You flip a switch — the lights turn on. You flip it again — off they go. The internal workings that create that light can come from a complex system of light switch wiring — especially in older construction that may not be up to modern code.</p>

In addition to the importance of proper installation, undergoing regular generator maintenance is incredibly important for homeowners and businesses who want their generator to last as long as possible and operate as efficiently as possible.</p>

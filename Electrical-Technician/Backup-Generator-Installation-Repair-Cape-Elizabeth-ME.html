In commercial and industrial settings, electrical contractors work on large projects in office buildings, schools, hospitals, as well as factories, assembly plants and distribution centers, among many others.</p>
<p>When the power goes out, a standby home generator turns on automatically in a few seconds and keeps the power on at your house.

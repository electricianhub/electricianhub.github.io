For homes larger than 3,500 to 4,000 square feet, you may even need two breaker panels, a 200 Amp one and an additional 100 to 200 Amp panel to supplement it.

The generator is paired with a transfer switch containing a predetermined number of circuits based on the generator's kW power rating. Damaged power cords are a serious residential electrical safety risk, and they are capable of causing both fires and electrocution.</p>

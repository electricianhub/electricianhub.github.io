The wrong tools could damage your house wiring, which raises the risk of electrical shock or fires. With surge protection, you want to spend as much as you need to in order to get the best protection possible.</p>
<p>If you want a whole house generator that can power 90-100% of your home on natural gas or propane, call a pro from the start. Plugging too many items into outlets is the cause of many house fires.

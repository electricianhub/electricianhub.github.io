<p>Outdoor lighting has many benefits but most importantly it provides homeowners with extra safety and security during night time hours. Breakers Are Tripping - When you have a breaker that's tripping, there's too much power that's flowing through your circuit. In this course, you will learn about the fundamentals of series and parallel circuits as well as how to calculate current, voltage, and resistance in them. The goal of learning about electrical safety is to not become an expert in electricity or electrical repair but to gain enough knowledge to be able to react in an emergency. Set a voltage tester to "Volts" and touch the tip of each tester-wire to a terminal screw at opposite sides of the switch-outlet.</p>
<p>Plan on obtaining a variety of licenses if you want to be an electrical contractor. Your electrician will know how to tackle even the most complicated of tasks, such as installing dimmer switch systems or hanging light fixtures. After taking the assessment, respondents are directed to ESFI's comprehensive library of safety resources and links to help them find the information to take the next step in improving the electrical safety of their workplace. In this illustration, you can see the red hot lead” wires of the dimmer are connected to the inbound black wire from the electrical source (the electrical panel) and the black wire that goes to the light fixture's black wire which, in this case, is a white wire that has been taped with black electrical tape.</p>

Each home has its own unique story and reason for professional landscape lighting. At The Meridian Company, our electricians are licensed and insured to work in your home and have the years of experience needed to safely handle your breaker panel repairs and replacements.</p>

<p>Most single-pole switches will have two black wires connected to the switch — one will serve as the "hot" wire, bringing power to the switch, and the other is the "load" wire, sending power out to the light. Circuit breakers stop circuits from becoming overloaded and starting fires. Wiremen are generally trained in one of five primary specialties: commercial, residential, light industrial, industrial, and low-voltage wiring, more commonly known as Voice-Data-Video, or VDV.</p>

In some instances, such as some switch legs, the function of the wires will be indicated by colored electrical tape.</p>

Unless your outlets are switched, with a switch somewhere in the kitchen, (that would be very unusual), each outlet appears to have 2 circuits going to it. Verify this if possible, by turning off the breakers. Turn the power back on and make sure that the outlet works properly by plugging in a lamp and checking to see that the light switch turns the lamp on and off.</p>
<p>After completing an apprenticeship program, electricians are considered to be journey workers and may perform duties on their own, subject to any local licensing requirements. To stay safe - make sure you always turn off the circuit breaker or remove proper fuses before tackling a this sort of home improvement project or when replacing a piece of electrical equipment.

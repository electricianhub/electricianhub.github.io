<p>The installation went very smoothly and took less time than I had anticipated. If this occurs, check the wiring and circuit breaker and contact an electrician. In Florida, the current minimum amperage for an electrical panel is a 100 amp service but many older homes do not even have this capacity. For lights, turn the light switch on and off to be sure. In some instances, such as some switch legs, the function of the wires will be indicated by colored electrical tape.</p>
<p>Your value here goes to waste if you're not deliberate about it. Whether you create a patio, barbecue island, or a full outdoor kitchen, you have a great place for entertaining, spending time with family, or just getting some fresh air in the safety of your own home.

<p>Depending on when your home was built and how much electricity you use, you may need electric panel repair, replacement, or a sub-panel added to keep up with demand. I chose to break off the little tab on the hot side of the receptacle to make half of it switched and the other half always powered. The transformer will be placed close to the power source, and some are even rated for indoor installation.

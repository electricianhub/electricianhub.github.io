We are a leading company that designs, manufactures and market a range of electronic products and solutions for electrical testing, tests and measurement equipment related to the commissioning and maintenance in substations, power plants and energy systems.</p>

<p>A plus for running propane over NG is that you will get the full 20KW out of the genset rather than a 20% reduction (e.g. 18KW) using NG.

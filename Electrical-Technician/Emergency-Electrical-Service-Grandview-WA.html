Another popular trend in outdoor lighting is small lights that are clustered together and hidden in plants.

<p>But you should also know the difference between wires and cables and when you use a stranded versus solid wire. The key, as with other wiring methods, is to group fixtures in close proximity of one another so the variation in voltage is slight from one fixture to another. Most states require electricians to pass a test and be licensed. In all events, regardless of which connection point you are using, receptacles and switches have a designated side or screw or connector set for the white (neutral wire) (typically the side that has a silver colored screw and that is marked NEUTRAL on the device) and for the black (hot wire) (typically the side that has a brass-colored screwed and is marked LINE or HOT or BLACKI).</p>

We believe that electric service, while a dramatically changing industry, is rooted in two historical principals - always strive to reduce cost, and always offer the most continuous, highest quality power possible.</p>
<p>We will also be mindful of your neighbors, suggesting lighting improvements that illuminate your space without affecting nearby yards or interfering with passing cars. You will need to create a circuit by connecting your lights with wire in a routered cavity in the railing or under the deck to protect them and hide them from view. Though MOVs in common surge strips can be destroyed after a powerful surge, the ones used in whole-house systems are made to shunt large surges and last for years.</p>

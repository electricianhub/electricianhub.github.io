That is, if a power grid suffers an outage, the generator can provide redundancy. Either way, one receptacle will be controlled by the light switch and the other receptacle will always be powered on no matter what.</p>

Breaker and fuse box panels are complicated and delicate pieces of equipment. Some prefer to have slightly brighter lights that allow them to see their entire yard, this gives them a sense of security; others prefer a much more subdued light that creates an ambience rather than a light show.

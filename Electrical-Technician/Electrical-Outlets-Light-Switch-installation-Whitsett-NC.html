Keep Your Generator Running - A well-oiled machine will stand up over time and run more reliably than those that don't receive the maintenance they need. If there's no neutral in the box, shop for a smart switch that doesn't require a neutral. Most standby generators make use of new technologies that muffle sound to residential-friendly levels.

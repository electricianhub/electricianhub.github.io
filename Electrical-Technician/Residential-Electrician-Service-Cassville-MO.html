However, this is rather a minor con, offset by much power purchase and maintenance costs of portable generators. Unlike electricians or landscaping companies, custom outdoor lighting design, installation, and service is all we do.

<p>The National Electrical Code (NEC) and local building codes regulate the types of wire and cable that can be used in specific electrical applications, as well as the manner of installation. Instead, splice the neutrals from the feed to the GFCI and the under-sink outlet together, splice a short jumper to the black feed to the GFCI, and connect that jumper to a new switch. If necessary, remove all the wires but one, check the outlet for power, and then use a different wire.</p>

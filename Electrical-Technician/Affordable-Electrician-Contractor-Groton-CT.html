<p>This is the key to ensuring that your generator will perform when you need it the most and will not let you down upon the next power outage. Don't splice equipment cords to repair damage or to extend the original length. You might be able to add circuits to your existing panel, but more often than not, you'll need a new electrical panel with more amps to handle the additional load.

<p>As with all machinery, parts wear and tear over time due to years of use and accidents. Wires connect to the transformer and stretch out along the ground to attach to each light fixture.

You may be tempted to shove the wires into the box, but care and precision are important here. Putting it straight, the whole house surge protector shields your home's appliances from getting damaged due to surplus electricity flow.</p>

<p>Upgrading your main service panel is the best way to guarantee that your system won't leave you in the dark when you need it most. In many homes, if a room does not have an overhead light, most builders will install a switch that controls half of the outlets in the room.

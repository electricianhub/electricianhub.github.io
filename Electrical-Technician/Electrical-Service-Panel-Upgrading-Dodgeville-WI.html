<p>Electrical safety needs to be taught to children early on. Safety plugs should be inserted in unused outlets when toddlers are in the home. For example, when an outlet is not working, they may use a multimeter to check the voltage, amperage, or resistance to determine the best course of action. Perform basic circuit checks for shorts, opens and ground faults using a multimeter.

If you do decide to upgrade your electrical panel, the best time to do it is when you're undertaking another remodel.

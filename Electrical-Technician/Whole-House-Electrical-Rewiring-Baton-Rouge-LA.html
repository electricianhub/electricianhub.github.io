<p>In older installations, the switch may only be connected with two wires, the incoming and outgoing black supply wire, and there may not be much slack wire in the junction box. TIP: New outlets have square plastic washers on the mounting screws to prevent them from falling out, therefore the mounting screws will generally not detach from the power source outlet.

The power supply cannot be installed in a concealed location behind drywall or where access is rendered inaccessible without damaging or destroying the building finish.</p>
<p>This actually isn't too rare, as outlet junction boxes sometimes serve as junction boxes for other circuits passing through. A switch counts as two wires.

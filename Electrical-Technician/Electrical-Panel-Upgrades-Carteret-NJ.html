<p>You can expect the whole house generator to start working within five minutes of power outage. Unlike portable generators, permanent standby generators can spring into action very quickly. You might carefully remove and re-route the existing wire lower in the wall or you might buy all new electrical wire - depending on the age and condition of the existing materials. Over time, the connections between electrical wires and switches or outlets can loosen Check to make sure that all outlet covers and switch plates are in good condition and that the wires inside are secure.</p>
<p>Having identified your power source and have cut the opening for your new outlet you are ready to begin wiring. On average, permanent standby generators produce anywhere from 5,000 to 20,000 watts depending upon the model you choose for your home's electrical needs. Some electricians say that if the wires are touched or disturbed in any way the entire wiring needs to be replaced. If the power goes out, an electronic switch automatically signals the unit to turn on, keeping essential household systems and appliances running even if you're miles away.</p>
<p>Many models are given a rating of 62 decibels which is similar to most of the portable inverter generators reviewed , but that is often the noise level measured at 25 feet away. Quality standby generators will shut down if they lose oil pressure, overheat, or are being worked too hard. LED lights can be installed in practically any location and programmed to emit colors that homeowners prefer. Your circuit breakers frequently trip.

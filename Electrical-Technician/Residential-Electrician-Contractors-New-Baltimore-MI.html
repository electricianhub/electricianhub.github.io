<p>A surge protector protects your electrical equipment from internal component damage caused by power surges.

Since a traditional knob and tube electrical circuit lacks a ground wire, these circuits should be upgraded to new wire whenever possible. An electrician can help make wiring a light switch hassle-free.</p>

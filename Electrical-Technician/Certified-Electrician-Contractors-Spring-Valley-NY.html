<h2>Security Lighting Spring Valley New York</h2>
<p>Permanently installed generators run on either natural gas or propane. The size of the generator you need is directly related to the appliances you want to keep power running to. If you just needed a fridge to have power, the size of the generator would be much smaller. Connected to your LP or natural gas fuel supply, the backup generator kicks in within seconds of determining a power loss and can run as long as it takes for your utility power to turn back on.</p>

An electrician can advise you about how much power your home really needs.</p>
<p>Drug & Alcohol Free - All our electricians go through extensive background checks. One of the options you could look at is installing a wind turbine to generate electricity. Without a portable generator, life can become pretty uncomfortable when the power suddenly fails. A lightning strike near a building or overhead supply lines suddenly increases the voltage from 230 V to 3 or 6 kV. The resulting surge, which lasts a few microseconds, can destroy electronic components such as memory, processors, capacitors, and screens.</p>
<p>We are proud to employ over 100 of the best electricians, estimators, project managers and support staff. But, in this day and age, every home is equipped with advanced appliances and old fuse panels just aren't equipped to handle the electrical load.

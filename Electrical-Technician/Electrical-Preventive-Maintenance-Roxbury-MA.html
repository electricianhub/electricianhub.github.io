<p>An electrical contractor's licence is a business licence only. The ground-fault circuit interrupters are a must for affirming the electrical safety in wet locations.

Oftentimes, the light problem isn't from the light fixture itself, but from the light switch. Circuit breakers are contained within your electrical panel and their job is to protect the electrical circuits in your home or building by stopping the flow of electricity in the event of an overload, short-circuit, or other electrical fault.</p>

Outlets that are installed in a bathroom, above kitchen counter tops, or outside should be equipped with a ground fault interrupter circuit (GFI). An overloaded circuit blows the circuit breaker or fuse-the weakest link-in the circuit.</p>
<p>Residential switches and outlets are rated for 15, 20 and 30 amp. Cable, wire - underground per codes for line and low voltage , above ground at stake-mounted and tree mounted fixtures. AFCI circuit breakers and receptacles are designed to detect dangerous, abnormal arcing in branch circuits and cut off the power before a fire can start. This certificate may only be issued to a person or company who applies in writing and is the holder, or employs the holder, of a journeyman's certificate of qualification in Electrical Construction.</p>

Circuit Breaker: These GFCI outlets protect and entire circuit board rather than a single outlet. Electrical licenses are not awarded at the state level in New York. Never overload sockets, outlets, or cords.

And if you are not sure what a wire is connected to, just turn the breaker off, disconnect the wire and put a wago or a nut at the end of it and turn the circuit back on and see what is not working. After that time you expose yourself to potential electrical dangers by overloading your system with the latest electrical equipment.</p>
<p>Electricians always in the your area. Wire connections are the weakest point of any low voltage installation and are susceptible to wicking and water infiltration.

If you're experiencing any malfunctions with your breaker panel, it's important to take it seriously and consult with a trained electrician to take a look at what might be causing problems. When you turn on a light switch, power goes to the light through the hot” (black) wire and then back through the neutral (white) wire to the ground.</p>
<p>Another option is to wire the lights in a loop, with the wire returning to the transformer. If it was you have two circuits in each box and outlet, and very likely have 240 volts in the outlet boxes, which is OK but any such box (and outlet) needs labeled indicating that. This should also include any trees, garden decor, or special features of the landscaping Taking measurements will also help when it comes time to purchase the lighting fixtures, particularly if you are going to use low voltage lighting, because you need to have the right amount of cabling for the entire project.</p>

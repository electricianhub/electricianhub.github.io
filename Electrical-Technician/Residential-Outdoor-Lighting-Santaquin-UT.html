We offer comprehensive electrical services to meet your needs, from installing new lighting and wiring to the repair of existing wiring and fixtures. According to the National Fire Protection Association, U.S. fire departments responded to an estimated annual average of 47,820 reported home structure fires in 2007-2011- all started by electrical malfunctions.</p>

The average American home is hit by more than 20 power surges every single day. However, if the device is sensitive to fluctuations and performance is sorely affected by fluctuations, you need to hook it up to a surge protector.</p>

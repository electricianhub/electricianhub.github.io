Instead of a single receptacle that has been split-wired to feed from two different circuits (usually using a common neutral and properly wired in the panel etc), you often see a 4" box with a pair of receptacles that side by side are run from different circuits instead of up and down different circuits in the same box. Be sure to include all landscape features, buildings, individual light fixtures, and power supplies in your drawing.</p>
<p>Before you do any digging, call a professional locator service, and carefully look around your property for where sprinkler lines, water mains, cable TV and phone wires are buried. Use cords that are in good shape, with no fraying or exposed wiring. Believe it or not, not all electricians” know what they are doing. It is not hard to find excellent and safe lighting choices with low voltage technology created especially to live up your property. The cables for low voltage lighting are usually 10 or 12 gauge wire.</p>

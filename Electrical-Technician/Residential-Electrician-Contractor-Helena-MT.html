<p>As a licensed electrician, it is your responsibility to understand the legislation and regulations in place at any time and work in accordance with them. To get it, you need to have 576 hours of training and 8,000 hours of working experience. You must first check the line voltage and fuses, as shown in Figure 42. Place the voltmeter probes on the hot side of the line fuses as shown at position A. A line voltage reading tells you that your voltmeter is operational and that you have voltage to the source side of the line fuses L1-L2.</p>

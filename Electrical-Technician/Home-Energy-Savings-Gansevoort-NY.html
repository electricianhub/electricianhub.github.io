<p>Have you ever been driving around at night and seen a home with a beautiful lit up yard? So, do yourself a favor and call Hall Oil for your whole house generator installation. As noted above, low-voltage lighting components must be used in accordance with the product ratings, markings, and instructions. Look for a mounting bracket that is attached to your electrical box; this is where you'll install the chandelier.

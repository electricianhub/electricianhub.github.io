A system can be configured with floodlights placed high in either corner of the yard or on corners of the house to keep the property safe. In the past, when low voltage tungsten bulbs were used, the fixtures where daisy- chained with no real attention paid to bulb brightness, color or longevity because tungsten bulbs can burn for years on very little voltage.</p>

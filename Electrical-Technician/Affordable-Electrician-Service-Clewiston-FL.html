<p>A limited electrical contractor will require a Montana licensed journeyman electrician as the responsible party and limits the electrical work to residential construction consisting of less than five living units in a single structure. However, you may be able to shorten your apprenticeship by getting credit for some of the classroom hours from your pre-apprenticeship program. And even if you do, your employer may not want you to practice troubleshooting on equipment they depend on. Until you become reasonably competent, it is best to practice troubleshooting in a controlled environment.</p>
<p>The process is less complicated because low-voltage schemes don't require the strict installation codes or permits that high-voltage systems require, Hart says. Master Special - If you do not qualify for a master electrician license, this license qualifies you to work in the specialty areas of electric signs, elevators, HVAC, primary distribution systems, pools, and refrigeration.

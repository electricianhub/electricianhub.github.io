The lighting designer used spotlights for the columns and set brightness to balance the illumination from the coach lights on either side of the door. Some dimmer switches use a resistor to dim the light and it is common for them to get warm. It does this by continuously sensing utility power and after an outage is detected, it simultaneously starts the engine and disconnects power coming from the line and energizes your home's panel through generator power.</p>

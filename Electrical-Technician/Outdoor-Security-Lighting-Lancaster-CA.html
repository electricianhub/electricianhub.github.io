Overloads - Electrical fires are frequently caused by overloaded equipment and circuits. In contrast, Lucifer Lighting and others point out that when selecting an electrical wire (conductor) size for the low-voltage devices such as downlights used indoors or outside, the wire needs to be chosen based also on the distance between the light fixture and the low voltage transformer.</p>

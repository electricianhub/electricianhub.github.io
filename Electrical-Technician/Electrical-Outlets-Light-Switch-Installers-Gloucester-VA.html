<p>If your two plug ins (two electrical receptacles) are located in the same electrical box (we call this a "quad" electrical receptacle installation since each individual receptacle provides connections for two wall plugs), you'll want to wire the hot and neutral to one pair of screws on the first receptacle, and use short black and white jumper wires to connect the the proper terminals on the first receptacle to the second one in the same box. If the outlets ARE half hot, with one half of it switched, it will not be possible to reproduce that with the new outlets.</p>

Here is an example of what I'm talking about or a situation that could become complicated and if you're not going to redo your electrical system, it wouldn't be a bad idea to avoid walking around these exposed wires in your attic.</p>
<p>Residential switches and outlets are rated for 15, 20 and 30 amp. Cable, wire - underground per codes for line and low voltage , above ground at stake-mounted and tree mounted fixtures.

This certificate may only be issued to a person or company who applies in writing and is the holder, or employs the holder, of a journeyman's certificate of qualification in Electrical Construction.</p>
<p>Depending on total wattage, an inverter generator can be used for many emergency situations during a home power outage. Electricity flows through the hot wire, entering the switch and then into the light fixture, and then returns back through the neutral wire.

This approach is general in nature allowing it to be used on any type of electrical circuit.</p>

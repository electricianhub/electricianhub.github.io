<p>Your panel is responsible for metering out the right amount of voltage needed to power a series of electrical outlets. Normally, for most homeowners a portable generator of the capacity of 5000 to 6000 watts may be sufficient. Power cables may have fittings in the tray to maintain clearance between the conductors, but small control wiring is often installed without any intentional spacing between cables.

A power surge will travel through any wire into a house, leaving common appliances and sensitive electronic equipment vulnerable to serious damage. This approach is general in nature allowing it to be used on any type of electrical circuit.</p>
<p>One of the primary reasons for upgrading an electric panel is because it simply does not have the capacity to deal with modern appliances.

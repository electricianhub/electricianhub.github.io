The goal of learning about electrical safety is to not become an expert in electricity or electrical repair but to gain enough knowledge to be able to react in an emergency. Set a voltage tester to "Volts" and touch the tip of each tester-wire to a terminal screw at opposite sides of the switch-outlet.</p>

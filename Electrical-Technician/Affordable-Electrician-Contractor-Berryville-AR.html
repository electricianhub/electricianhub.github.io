<p>Our electricians have been fully trained in identifying problems with circuit breakers and panels. If you're not sure what types of fixtures you'll need, take a look at our landscape lighting design post It's separated by different exterior areas and shows each type of light that's typically used in those locations. A portable generator can provide power to run some basic electrical appliances like lighting, furnaces, televisions, refrigerators and water well pumps.</p>

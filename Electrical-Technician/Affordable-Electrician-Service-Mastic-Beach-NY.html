<p>If you're like the average person, you use your computer a lot.

The source neutral remains pigtailed to the neutral on the receptacle and the new neutral wire is added to the splice.</p>
<p>If your two plug ins (two electrical receptacles) are located in the same electrical box (we call this a "quad" electrical receptacle installation since each individual receptacle provides connections for two wall plugs), you'll want to wire the hot and neutral to one pair of screws on the first receptacle, and use short black and white jumper wires to connect the the proper terminals on the first receptacle to the second one in the same box.

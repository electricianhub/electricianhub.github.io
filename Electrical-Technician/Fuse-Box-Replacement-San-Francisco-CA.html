<h3>Things to Look For in Electrical Contractor in San Francisco CA</h3>
<p>Child safety wall plates should be installed to cover socket holes when electrical outlets are not in use. If you see sparks, smell something burning (especially if it smells like rubber) or find evidence of electrical shorting like blackened spots and melted insulators, shut off the device, disconnect the electricity that serves that portion of your home and call an electrician. Surge protectors and power strips can be used safely if they are not overloaded.</p>
<p>If necessary, loosen the screws a half-turn and align the switch-outlet vertically by hand, then tighten the screws. If any outlet emits a burning odor or sparks, shut down the electrical panel right away and call an electrician for help , as you could be at immediate risk for fire.

Master - As a master electrician, you could work as a foreman or team leader supervising journeyman and apprentice electricians. A merger between Charles Coffin's Thomson-Houston Electric Company and Thomas Edison's Edison General Electric Company in 1892 led to the creation of GE. Edison's company had by then constructed America's first central power station in New York.</p>

<p>Before a contractor's licence can be issued, the applicant must have held an Electrical Mechanic's Licence for at least two years. When working properly the electricity is fed through the positive wire into a load, such as an appliance, then it returns to the electrical panel via the neutral wire.

To figure out exactly where the wires are, you'll look fÂ­or the outlets and appliances that each wire connects to. You'll also figure out which circuit breaker applies to which section of your home's wiring. These devices improve electrical safety by tripping and disconnecting power transmission when the line connecting the electric panel and your appliances becomes overloaded and at risk of heating up and burning.</p>

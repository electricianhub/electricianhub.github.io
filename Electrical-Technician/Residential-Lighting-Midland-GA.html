<p>Basically, electrical wires are color coded to prevent wiring errors. Low voltage lighting is less permanent than standard line voltage lighting, which is quite difficult to re-arrange. More specifically, when electrical systems are damaged in a natural or man-made disaster, electricians need to make critical decisions about whether the electrical equipment that was damaged can be salvaged or not.

Instead, splice the neutrals from the feed to the GFCI and the under-sink outlet together, splice a short jumper to the black feed to the GFCI, and connect that jumper to a new switch. If necessary, remove all the wires but one, check the outlet for power, and then use a different wire.</p>

The kit includes the lights, cables, and transformer. Sometimes this leads to spikes in the power moving through your local electrical grid, which can damage unprotected electronics. Because they can rely on remote power sources, LEDs powered with low voltage permit creative placement of lighting. Note as the power (black wire comes in and hits the receptacle on the bottom and also heads off the switch).</p>

When you own a generator and have it installed it will already be connected to your household electrical system so that it is able to activate itself as soon as the power goes out.</p>
<p>When the power goes out, a standby home generator turns on automatically in a few seconds and keeps the power on at your house. For commercial installs, we can set the generators to send diagnostic information to the IT department or another internal department via email or text. But to properly understand the full benefits of low voltage lighting, we should start here: low voltage lighting is more of a tactical application than a budgetary or energy-saving one, though there may be moderate gains in these areas in certain instances.</p>

<p>Eaton's mission is to improve the quality of life and the environment through the use of power management technologies and services. Due to the advanced power management system that's installed in the 40445 as well as the 8kw power output, the carbon footprint of this generator is one of the smallest in its class. The further you get from the transformer and its power supply, the more resistance occurs in the circuit which causes the voltage to decrease. Electrical Contractor - You must be or employ a master electrician.</p>
<p>If you're going to be using a 15 amp GFI and you are going to be less than 80 feet away from the electrical panel you can use 14 gauge electrical wires.

<p>A plus for running propane over NG is that you will get the full 20KW out of the genset rather than a 20% reduction (e.g. 18KW) using NG.

Breakers Won't Remain Reset: If you notice that a reset circuit breaker in your electrical panel won't stay reset or restore power, then it's very likely that you have a faulty service panel.</p>

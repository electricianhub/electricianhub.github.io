The live feed from the distribution board connects to the terminal marked ‘common' in the double pole switch while the wire from the neutral terminal runs to the second double pole switch via a separate 3 wire cable.</p>

Electrical panels have evolved over time, and many designs that were common in the mid-20th century no longer meet contemporary electrical needs.</p>

Here's MY conundrumâ€¦ I want to build myself a custom POWER BAR or two, to add outlets into my bench and desk areas. Turn off the mains electricity, and then remove all of the circuits from the panel. But generators come in a range of types, sizes and costs, so you'll want to put a fair amount of thought into this high-involvement purchase.

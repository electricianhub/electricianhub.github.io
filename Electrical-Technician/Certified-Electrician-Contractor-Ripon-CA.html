<p>Keep in mind that these two measurements are only part of the equation in a products ability to protect your equipment from surges or the possibility of a fire.

Now, the bigger concern is expensive devices like televisions and entertainment systems that might plug directly into a cable line.</p>
<p>Pups are busy, and they may gnaw on an electrical cord without anyone realizing it. If you see burns in or around your pet's mouth, singed hair or whiskers around the mouth, or notice shortness of breath or other respiratory issues, seek immediate medical attention for your pet. Many of the newer modeled homes come with these fancy lighting systems already in place but if you live in an older home you do not have you deal with the outdated dull lighting that is currently in place.</p>

If any outlet emits a burning odor or sparks, shut down the electrical panel right away and call an electrician for help , as you could be at immediate risk for fire. If the surge protector worked TOO effectively, and siphoned away too much of the electric current then the appliance would not be able to work. For example, one circuit breaker may control the electricity to the bathroom, and one may control the outlets and lights in the living room.</p>

<p>There are supposedly various reasons behind this light installation problem. Older appliances could have grounding issues that might put you at risk for a shock. Install an interlock device instead, which costs $100-$200 less than a transfer switch and can be installed in less time by an electrician. The result of a properly installed system is a beautifully illuminated landscape and a safe installation. Photocells can be used to automatically switch lights on and off at dusk and dawn, and some light fittings come with these built in. Similarly PIR detectors switch lights on when someone approaches, and these are often built in to security lights.</p>

<p>Most homeowners know how to reset a circuit breaker that trips, but few people besides electricians give the industrial grey box in the garage or laundry room much thought until the lights go out. For as long as the surge voltage lasts, the semiconductor channels harmful current to ground. Ambient light from the spotlights you do use can also illuminate and create an interplay of light and shadow of nearby plants and foliage. Most transformers are rated to handle a load of 100 to 300 watts; the higher the rating, the longer the cable—and thus the more light fixtures—you can connect to the system.</p>

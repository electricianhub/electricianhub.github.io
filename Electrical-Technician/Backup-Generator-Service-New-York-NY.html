This makes them much more common for large-scale outdoor projects, including landscape lighting projects. Indoor reduced voltage lighting is also very affordable and convenient to use. If you can't get the transformer close enough to your light fixtures you will need to up the voltage that your line carries. Worn cords and damaged plugs increase your risk of both fires and electrical shocks.</p>
<p>According to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, each year nearly 400 people across the U.S. are accidentally electrocuted.

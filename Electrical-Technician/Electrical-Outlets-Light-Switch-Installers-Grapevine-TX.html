Thunderstorms and power outages can cause damaging electrical surges. Do not let electrical faults spoil your evening or day. You will be able to remove the old ceiling fixture, to see how easy the wiring from the house, to the light fixture, actually is. Some states may require a master electrician to either perform or supervise the work.</p>

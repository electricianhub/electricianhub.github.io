<p>An SPD can damp the spike down to a value compatible with that which most connected appliances can withstand: approximately 1.5 kV. All devices within 10 meters of the switchboard are effectively protected. Even better, opt for a quality battery backup unit (#ad) instead of a surge protector. It might be possible, but it would require that each outlet have the same wires in it. A half hot requires two colored wires, usually black and red, but it could be two black wires.</p>

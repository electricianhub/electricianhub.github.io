Power surges can happen to literally anybody and you want to be prepared when it happens to you. Choosing the right electrician for either a residential or commercial task is no small feat. You flip a switch — the lights turn on. You flip it again — off they go. The internal workings that create that light can come from a complex system of light switch wiring — especially in older construction that may not be up to modern code.</p>

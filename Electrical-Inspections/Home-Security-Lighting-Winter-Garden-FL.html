Portable generators offer the luxury of power when you don't have it at a fraction of the cost of whole-house generators. At the switch, the neutral wire is capped unless needed to power a smart switch such as a new dimmer. Electricians in huge factories oftentimes have maintenance work that is more multifaceted.</p>

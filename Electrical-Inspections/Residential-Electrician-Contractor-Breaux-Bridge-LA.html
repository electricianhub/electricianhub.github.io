<p>Standard electrical code wiring practices in the United States require the grounding conductor to be green or a non-insulated bare wire. Fusing on 120V circuits powering lights, electrical receptacles, and other such devices. Homes built before 1965 typically have ungrounded two-pronged outlets, while newer construction will usually have three-pronged outlets, which include a hot, neutral and ground wire. Whether you're looking to upgrade your home's electricity or need an electric company for your new construction, our certified, licensed electricians will get the job done right.</p>
<p>If the breaker panel in your home is in poor condition, you may end up with no power in your house or worse.

Breakers Won't Remain Reset: If you notice that a reset circuit breaker in your electrical panel won't stay reset or restore power, then it's very likely that you have a faulty service panel.</p>

<p>The National Electrical Code (NEC) and local building codes regulate the types of wire and cable that can be used in specific electrical applications, as well as the manner of installation.

If you are continually resetting breakers or replacing fuses then there is likely to be a fault and more current is trying to be drawn than the circuit is designed for.

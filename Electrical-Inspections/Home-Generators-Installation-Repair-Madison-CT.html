You would need a big standby generator to power such appliances even during a power outage.

In Florida, the current minimum amperage for an electrical panel is a 100 amp service but many older homes do not even have this capacity. For lights, turn the light switch on and off to be sure. In some instances, such as some switch legs, the function of the wires will be indicated by colored electrical tape.</p>
<p>A licensed electrician can check your electrical panel, tighten any wires that need it, and even use an infrared tester to identify which circuit breakers are getting too hot in the fuse box. To be up to code and ensure you're not potentially endangering power workers, you should run the generator into a power transfer switch.

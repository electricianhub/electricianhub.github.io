<p>If you've ever walked into a home where the ceiling fan is hanging or separated from the ceiling and ever wondered what was causing the problem, you're about to find out. Voltage is a measure of a difference in electric potential energy. The tests have questions related to the National Electrical Code and state and local electrical codes, all of which set standards for the safe installation of electrical wiring and equipment. A: The National Electrical Code (NEC) governs the size of the electrical panel for new homes or remodeled homes. Lighting a pond or water feature allows you to enjoy it day or night. Our team designs and installs custom outdoor lighting to accentuate features of your home, landscaping, subdivision entrance, or business.</p>

<p>Generators are available through LI Power Solutions, fully installed with no money down. Electricians made a median salary of $55,190 in 2018.

<p>A master electrician can own his own business or work for another company. Instead of a single receptacle that has been split-wired to feed from two different circuits (usually using a common neutral and properly wired in the panel etc), you often see a 4" box with a pair of receptacles that side by side are run from different circuits instead of up and down different circuits in the same box. Be sure to include all landscape features, buildings, individual light fixtures, and power supplies in your drawing.</p>
<p>If you already have access to gas lines, consider one of the many propane generators or natural gas generators.

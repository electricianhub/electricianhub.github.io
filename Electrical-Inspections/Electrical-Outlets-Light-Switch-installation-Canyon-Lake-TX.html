Touch switches have no moving parts and electronically switch the light circuit. You can count on our team of licensed professionals to install or repair your lighting fixtures using top notch equipment that will help to prevent future damage from happening. In our commercial lighting repairs, we do introduce advanced lighting systems powered by energy saving light points.</p>
<p>Most single-pole switches will have two black wires connected to the switch — one will serve as the "hot" wire, bringing power to the switch, and the other is the "load" wire, sending power out to the light. Circuit breakers stop circuits from becoming overloaded and starting fires. Wiremen are generally trained in one of five primary specialties: commercial, residential, light industrial, industrial, and low-voltage wiring, more commonly known as Voice-Data-Video, or VDV.</p>

A Generac managed whole-house generator manages the power requirements of each of your individual appliances. Because installing individual switches and their wiring is lower in cost than installing a 120-volt-rated switch and wire in the same location, a low-voltage-wired home may have multiple switches in multiple locations all controlling the same light or other device. They also do not have a main breaker switch to stop all power from flowing into the panel.</p>

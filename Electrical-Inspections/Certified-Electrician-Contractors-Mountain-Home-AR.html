<p>When looking for a generator, you should really be looking at a natural gas generator. As a major player in the Electrical & Automation industry, we offer turnkey electrical & automation solutions for oil & gas, cement, metal and other manufacturing industries; infrastructure as well as utilities like power and water. The 8 and 10 gauge wire is mainly used to extend the distance from the transformer to your first fixture on that run. If you notice that your lights dim when you use appliances such as a microwave or hair dryer, that is an indicator that your breaker panel is in need of repairs.</p>

<p>It sounds like the entire outlet is switched, but with a red wire there I would suspect that there is a black wire somewhere back in the box, likely feeding other outlets. Furthermore, NEC Sections 411.5(A) and 250.22(4) do not permit the secondary of a low-voltage lighting system transformer to be grounded for any reason. When the low-voltage lighting system is being installed in permanent cabinets with a remote power source connected to fixed wiring, these products are required to comply with UL 2108 for low-voltage incandescent luminaires and luminaire fittings.</p>

Your hardwired lighting, HVAC system, and anything plugged into that circuit of wiring can get fried too.

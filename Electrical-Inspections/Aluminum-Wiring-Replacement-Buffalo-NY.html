<p>The main of the rules is to reduce the number of deaths, injuries and fires caused by faulty electrical installations. Electricians usually must complete a minimum number of continuing education hours every year to maintain their license, as well as periodically pass another examination. When power is restored, the transfer switch shuts off the generator. Low voltage lighting is shockless and safe to use around children and pets. The transformer needs to have enough capacity to support the cumulative wattage of the lights in the system.</p>
<p>Drug & Alcohol Free - All our electricians go through extensive background checks. One of the options you could look at is installing a wind turbine to generate electricity. Without a portable generator, life can become pretty uncomfortable when the power suddenly fails.

The resulting surge, which lasts a few microseconds, can destroy electronic components such as memory, processors, capacitors, and screens.</p>

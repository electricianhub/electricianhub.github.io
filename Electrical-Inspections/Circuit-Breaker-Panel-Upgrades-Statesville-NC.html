If a property is experiencing flickering lights, frequently blown circuits, or malfunctioning outlets, the electrical panel may need be inspected, especially if it is determined there are no wiring issues or issues with electrical appliances. It seems like it would be easier to convert the outlet to always-on, cap the wires, and install a wireless remote wall mount that could control the smart light switch I might add in place of the current dimmer.</p>
<p>Remember that during the installation it is desirable to include a timer or a daylight sensor so that the lighting is automatically switched off during daylight hours.

<h2>Home Generators Installation & Repair El Sobrante California</h2>
<p>As briefly explained above, the black wires are the power (or hot”) wires and the white wires are the neutral (or return”) wires. Someone turns the lights ON at switch #1.

Utility - Lighting that fulfills this requirement is usually going to be used to light a walkway or driveway, or some other outdoor structure such as a carport or shed.</p>

<p>If you've forgotten which two black were hooked to the same timer wire you may have to play with them, changing configurations, to get what you want, but in any case it sounds like two black wires should be joined together and go to one switch terminal and the third black goes to the other switch terminal. Use power boards with in-built safety devices to avoid a power outlet overload.

After completing four years (for a total of 8,000 hours) as an apprentice working under an electrical contractor, you will be ready to write the journeyman's exam. The kit includes the lights, cables, and transformer. Sometimes this leads to spikes in the power moving through your local electrical grid, which can damage unprotected electronics.

In the diagram, the black is hot, the white is neutral is white, and the brown looking wire is a bare copper ground. The low-voltage wiring system uses small-gauge copper wires connected to low-voltage switches to switch on and off relays which in turn control the operation of lights and where desired, electrical receptacles, and other 120-Volt equipment in homes.</p>

Anon, the electrical circuit that powers an "outlet plug" or receptacle is connected, usually through building walls, ceilings, or floors, from the first receptacle in the particular series back to a fuse or circuit breaker connection in the electrical panel. In a common surge protector, there's a component known as MOV or metal oxide varistor, which diverts extra voltage and prevents damage to the electronic.</p>
<p>If you live in an older home, you may have outlets that don't have a third or grounded‚Äù hole. This is especially important if you have small children in the house; you'll want to keep all of the electrical outlets covered. Remember that even if an appliance is off‚Äù if it is still plugged in, it is still connected to electricity, therefore a potential shock hazard. Some electrical contractors specialize in maintenance and repair. At the same time electronics devices need the maximum protection that is available.</p>
<p>Additionally, some folks try to hide extension cords under rugs, carpets, furniture, and other items. 10 to 15 feet total cable length is pretty much the limit with a single tap 12 volt transformer however with a transformer running at 22 volts you can often have several 100 feet of cable. In addition to the importance of proper installation, undergoing regular generator maintenance is incredibly important for homeowners and businesses who want their generator to last as long as possible and operate as efficiently as possible.</p>

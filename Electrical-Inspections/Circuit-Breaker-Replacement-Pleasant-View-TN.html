A qualified electrician has the skills and proper equipment to install the chandelier safely and efficiently to enhance its function and appearance. They should also be able to describe the general operation of a circuit breaker, explain how to reset a tripped circuit breaker and how to rack out a circuit breaker, and describe the basic operation of pushbutton switches and rotary switches.</p>

Lutron and Touch-Plate offer upgraded systems that would allow you to continue to use your home's wiring, but would require new panels, relays, light switches, and other adaptations. Pigtail wires will require the use of silicone-filled wire nuts for connections. Seriously consider hiring an electrician who will allow you to do lots of the mundane work such as nailing up the boxes, running the cables between them, and even allowing you to connect up many of the switches and outlets after the drywall is up. But allow the electrician to do all the truly complex aspects that only come with years of experience.</p>

A surge protector is a gadget designed to ward electrical devices from voltage spikes.

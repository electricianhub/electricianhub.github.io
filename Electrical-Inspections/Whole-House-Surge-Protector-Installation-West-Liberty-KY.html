To be up to code and ensure you're not potentially endangering power workers, you should run the generator into a power transfer switch.

<h3>Lightning and Static Protection Best Practices in West Liberty KY</h3>
<p>Lighting draws attention to a house, which increases the chance of a neighbor or passerby catching a would-be thief in action.

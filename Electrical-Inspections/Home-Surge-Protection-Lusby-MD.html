Therefore, you have to have the skills and knowledge to do the job, use the right tools, and most importantly observe safety measures before you start any electrical project.</p>
<p>If you want a whole house generator that can power 90-100% of your home on natural gas or propane, call a pro from the start. Plugging too many items into outlets is the cause of many house fires. Older homes may have small electrical panels with minimal loads that may not be able to service high-power, modern appliances. When electrical contractors have a good understanding of what a job involves, they can then make plans on how to proceed.

<h3>Tips for Hiring Electrical Maintenance Service in Lusby MD</h3>
<p>After June 30, 2023, you must have completed a recognized electrical apprenticeship program. At this time, the ATS transfers to the electricity generated by the generator. The required fee for the journeymen electrician license test must be paid for in advance. As well, our generator maintenance services are available to both residential and commercial customers.

<p>If your home is more than 20 years old, has constant problems with flickering lights or tripped breakers, or constant electrical failures, chances are it needs a service upgrade. If you're trying to remodel and your electrical panel is out of date, it could cause some serious problems when remodeling. Thankfully, there is an economical solution available: whole-home surge protection, a breaker added to your main electrical panel by a Lee Company certified electrician.</p>

Should your generator or electrical system suffer issues which require repairs or servicing, our team is more than capable of tackling the problem.

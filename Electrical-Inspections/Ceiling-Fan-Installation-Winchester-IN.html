Outlets in bathrooms, kitchens, and other living areas with water should be installed a fair distance away from the water source. To make this happen, all you have to do is switch the places of the two black wires.

In this design philosophy, such events are already protected against by the SM device before the power supply. Whether you are looking to create a dramatic setting for your walkway, increase mood lighting in your living space, or provide bright lights to a dim work-space, we have you covered.</p>

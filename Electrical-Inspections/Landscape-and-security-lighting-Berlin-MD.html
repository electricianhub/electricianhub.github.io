<p>Make sure you attach the correct wires to the correct screws. Almost every building has an electrical power, communications, lighting, and control system that is installed during construction and maintained after that. A short circuit is generally an abnormal low-resistance current, in between two nodes of an electrical circuit that are usually meant to have different voltages.

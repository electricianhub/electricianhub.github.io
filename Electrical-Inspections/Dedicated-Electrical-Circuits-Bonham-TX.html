NOTE: Working inside an electrical panel is dangerous and is best left to a professional electrician. In a kit you should find enough lights for your yard, a transformer and plenty of wire. Occasional light installation issues happen every now and then in most households. They may also be caused by birds, animals and trees interfering with power lines, auto accidents involving utility poles, neighbors using major power equipment, faulty home wiring and many other factors.</p>
<p>We will also be mindful of your neighbors, suggesting lighting improvements that illuminate your space without affecting nearby yards or interfering with passing cars. You will need to create a circuit by connecting your lights with wire in a routered cavity in the railing or under the deck to protect them and hide them from view. Though MOVs in common surge strips can be destroyed after a powerful surge, the ones used in whole-house systems are made to shunt large surges and last for years.</p>

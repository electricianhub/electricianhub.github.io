In principle, it is easy to design silent switches in which the mechanical contacts do not directly control the current, but simply signal a solid-state device such as a thyristor to complete the circuit.</p>

Every day, all around the world, people depend on technology, transportation, energy and infrastructure to live, work and thrive.

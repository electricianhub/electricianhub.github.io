<p>When you have a generator installed, it will be able to detect the power outage and will kick into gear to keep the power running. It is very important to purchase the correct transformer for your lighting system. The investigation looked only into the wire connections at the outlets.

<p>We offer emergency electrician services day and night so you can rely on us in an emergency situation at you inner west Sydney home or office.

<p>The exception here is if the outlet that's controlled by the light switch is only connected to that light switch and there aren't any other wires. Here's what electrical cable looks like inside. Oftentimes, the light problem isn't from the light fixture itself, but from the light switch. Circuit breakers are contained within your electrical panel and their job is to protect the electrical circuits in your home or building by stopping the flow of electricity in the event of an overload, short-circuit, or other electrical fault.</p>

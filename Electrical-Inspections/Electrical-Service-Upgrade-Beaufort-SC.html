If you notice that your lights dim when you use appliances such as a microwave or hair dryer, that is an indicator that your breaker panel is in need of repairs.</p>
<p>You can do this by curling the wire around the screw itself and tightening it. You'll do this for all of the wires. Remove the switched wire and cap it with a wire nut, folding it neatly back into the box.

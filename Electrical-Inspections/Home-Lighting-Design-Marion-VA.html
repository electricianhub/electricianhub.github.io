Improperly wired panels and short circuits could spark a fire, causing your home to sustain fire and smoke damage. A home standby generator is a little bit more of a complex undertaking than just running a portable and using an extension cord and some surge protectors.</p>
<p>Tip: If a project calls for longer lengths of wire (such as 80 or more feet from the breaker), increase the gauge size to ensure that enough electricity can pass through it. We specialize in comprehensive electrical wiring services for every aspect of your residential or commercial property.

<p>Electrical contracting services for residential and commercial clients. Electricians know that glossing over details in a wiring project could at best result in non-functioning wiring, and at worst create a dangerous situation. A lightning surge protection device creates a barrier that prevents electricity from spiking suddenly during a storm. In addition, everything is already there to run another device, whether an outlet, light or something else, if need be. In the past, too many people have used the ground wire as a neutral, which may work but is not safe.</p>
<p>Inverter generators have more complex engines than comparable portable generators. Lawn mowers are machines, and like all things mechanical, they may break down or require maintenance from time to time. The erosion of the contacts is due to electrical wear.

Marine electricians work on electrical projects related to water-faring vessels, such as boats, ships, yachts, and other marine equipment. For many years savvy homeowners have tried to duplicate this beauty with landscape lighting in the yard around their homes and in their gardens.</p>
<p>The transformer has at least four wires attached to it. On one side, often called input‚Äù, there is usually a white wire and a black wire to connect to the main power or line voltage coming from your home. Her life may have been spared if the outdoor outlet that the lamp was connected to was equipped with a ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI). 4 Way Switch Wiring Diagrams- Diagrams for 4-way switch circuits including: various source and light locations, dimmer for a 4-way circuits, wiring for 4 locations, and troubleshooting tips.</p>

It acts as a semi-conductor to divert excess electrical power to a grounding wire. When you pull power from an existing receptacle for a new receptacle, the electrical code requires AFCI protection for both the existing wiring and the new wiring. One example of this sort of lighting is the High line Calo Spot 4 low voltage cable lighting from Bruck Lighting.</p>
<p>Our licensed electricians can inspect your electrical system and panel to help you determine if it is time for an electrical panel upgrade. Garden lighting can be used to accentuate the general layout of your garden.

Improperly wired panels and short circuits could spark a fire, causing your home to sustain fire and smoke damage. A home standby generator is a little bit more of a complex undertaking than just running a portable and using an extension cord and some surge protectors.</p>
<p>Tip: If a project calls for longer lengths of wire (such as 80 or more feet from the breaker), increase the gauge size to ensure that enough electricity can pass through it. We specialize in comprehensive electrical wiring services for every aspect of your residential or commercial property.

<p>Electrical contracting services for residential and commercial clients. Electricians know that glossing over details in a wiring project could at best result in non-functioning wiring, and at worst create a dangerous situation. A lightning surge protection device creates a barrier that prevents electricity from spiking suddenly during a storm. In addition, everything is already there to run another device, whether an outlet, light or something else, if need be. In the past, too many people have used the ground wire as a neutral, which may work but is not safe.</p>
<p>Inverter generators have more complex engines than comparable portable generators. Lawn mowers are machines, and like all things mechanical, they may break down or require maintenance from time to time. The erosion of the contacts is due to electrical wear. Use childproof plugs in electrical outlets to deter children from poking small items into them. You don't want just anyone tinkering with your light fixtures.

It's easy for the receptacle mounting screws to be deliberately left loose or to work loose - making that ground connection unreliable.</p>

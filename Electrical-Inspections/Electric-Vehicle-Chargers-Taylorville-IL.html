<p>A circuit breaker works as a switch that shuts off power when it detects an electrical overload. Lighting Tip: As tempting as it may be, don't use your shovel to push wires down into the trenches. GFCIs constantly monitor the electricity flowing in a circuit.

Upgrading the electrical panel should be your very last option.

With time, the connections between wires and switches or outlets tend to loosen up. Make sure all outlet covers and switch plates are in good condition, and ensure that the wires are securely inside.</p>

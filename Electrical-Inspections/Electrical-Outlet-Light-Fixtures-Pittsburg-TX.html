<p>As with all machinery, parts wear and tear over time due to years of use and accidents. Wires connect to the transformer and stretch out along the ground to attach to each light fixture. Inside the sheathing are at least two thermoplastic insulated wires of the same gauge, though different cables can have different gauges. You may be tempted to shove the wires into the box, but care and precision are important here.

<p>In order to wire your own home, you must comply with the requirements of the 2017 edition of the National Electrical Code (NEC).

Plus they run on natural gas or propane, which means they can operate for days or weeks on a full whole-house propane tank, or indefinitely in the case of natural-gas versions. However, homes not located on a gas service network use propane to fuel their standby generators. Generally, purchasing a good surge protector gives you the benefit of having lower electricity costs and better quality of your appliances.</p>

For commercial installs, we can set the generators to send diagnostic information to the IT department or another internal department via email or text.

<p>When buying a standby generator for your home, it is very important to choose the right sized generator. This diverts any electrical leaks from exposed live wires safely to the earth rather than through you. This wiring option isn't complicated by any means; it's just a bit more involved than plug-and-play connectors as it requires the use of wire cutters and strippers to tie into your main landscape line. We have been serving the Raleigh , Durham Apex , Cary , Chapel Hill , Morrisville , and Garner communities with emergency electrical service calls for more than 30 years.</p>

Smarten up your existing landscape lighting to control lights and adjust settings with the Ring App. Outdoor lighting not only extends the beauty of your landscape into the evening hours, it transforms the winter landscape from something mundane into a valued time of enjoyment.</p>
<p>You can use heavier gauge wire for the first run so there is less resistance, then switch to the smaller gauge for the runs with the lights on them. For the home circuit with a 120V outlet, the circuit must include ground wires up to code.

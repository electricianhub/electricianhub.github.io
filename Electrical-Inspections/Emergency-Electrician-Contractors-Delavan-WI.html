If the lights and receptacles are wired with a multi-wire circuit than it doesn't matter as both circuits, if wired correctly on the two pole circuit breakers, will shut off anyway. You must still remove the red (or whatever color is switched) wires and splice them together with a wire nut if there is more than one of them. Immediately addressing the problem with your electrical panel will help you avoid emergency situations and potential issues such as power surges, electrical shocks, and circuit overloads.</p>

Electrical panels can break down and become less and less efficient over time, and as the need for electricity in your home increases, they can become overwhelmed and break down.</p>
<p>Depending on total wattage, an inverter generator can be used for many emergency situations during a home power outage. Electricity flows through the hot wire, entering the switch and then into the light fixture, and then returns back through the neutral wire. A power surge will travel through any wire into a house, leaving common appliances and sensitive electronic equipment vulnerable to serious damage. This approach is general in nature allowing it to be used on any type of electrical circuit.</p>

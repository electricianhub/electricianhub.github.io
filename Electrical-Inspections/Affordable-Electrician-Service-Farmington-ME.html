Make S&B Electric your first call when it comes to electrical panel replacement and repair.</p>

<p>No matter the case, if you need lighting repair in Charlotte, you will want to have it fixed as soon as possible.

Now, the circuit is feeding through to the next outlet without having to have the device installed to carry the wires through. A standby generator system can protect everyone from unexpected power outages. Electrical safety inspections are one of the most important services we provide for our customers.

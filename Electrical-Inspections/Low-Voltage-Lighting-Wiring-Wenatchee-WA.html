For example, if each light is 5 watts and you have 10 lights, your total wattage is 50. You want a transformer that is 20% larger than what you need.

A qualified electrician has the skills and proper equipment to install the chandelier safely and efficiently to enhance its function and appearance. They should also be able to describe the general operation of a circuit breaker, explain how to reset a tripped circuit breaker and how to rack out a circuit breaker, and describe the basic operation of pushbutton switches and rotary switches.</p>
<p>Installation is simple; just use the real metal stake to install each light into the ground in the perfect location. And if more than 15 amps flows through the circuit, the breaker trips.

Simply plug a Switcheroo into your switched outlet, and then another Switcheroo into as many outlets that you want to turn on and off with your existing switch. Some older homes will have electrical panels that are not suited to handle the electrical demands of modern homes.</p>

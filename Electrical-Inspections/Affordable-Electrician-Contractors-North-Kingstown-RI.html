<p>Every machine needs maintenance and repairs and an electric scooter is not an exception to this. Surge protectors will indeed protect computers and other electronic devices from power surges and most distant lightning strikes, but they can't prevent a direct lighting strike from causing damage to connected devices.

<p>This creates a loose connection, and loose connections cause the wires in outlets to burn up and kill the rest of the circuit.

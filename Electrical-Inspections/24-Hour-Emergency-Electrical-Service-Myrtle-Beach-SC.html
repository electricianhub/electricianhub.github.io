For example, in Florida, electrical contractors may be locally registered (by filing evidence of a current occupational license and compliance with local examination and licensing requirements) or state certified (by taking and passing the state licensing examination).</p>

<p>And yes, each outlet you wish to be switched will need the tab broken off. The system will automatically shed‚Äù electrical items that are less important, then put them back online when more power is available.

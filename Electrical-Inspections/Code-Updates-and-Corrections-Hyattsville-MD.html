<p>Homes have much different electrical needs and power loads than large-scale commercial buildings. Almost everything in the world runs on electricity, which means that electricians have a great deal of room to specialize in the field. It is recommended to use power boards always with inbuilt safety devices like overload switches. If you are concerned about thieves or prowlers, having some properly positioned motion activated lighting will make you feel much safer while you sleep and these types of lights will generally cause any potential bandits to quickly flee the area.</p>
<p>The ground wire goes to the green ground screw on the outlet, the white wire goes to a silver screw, the black wire to one of the brass screws, and the red wire to the other brass screw.

A recent update to the National Electrical Code (NFPA 70, 2020) in article 314.27(C) now requires that all ceiling light electrical boxes in habitable rooms at likely fan locations, be rated for ceiling fan support.</p>

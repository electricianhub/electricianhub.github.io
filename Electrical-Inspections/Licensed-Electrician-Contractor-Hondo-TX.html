Low-voltage lighting systems shall comply with 411.4(A) or 411.4(B). Home builders no longer install fuse boxes into homes.

<p>Sadly, some electrical service companies don't answer the phone after hours. The professionals at Dan Wood Company understand that and will always make sure your home's electrical needs are meticulously taken care of-as they should be. A breaker box or a fuse panel in need of repair or replacement is no exception to this.

A circuit breaker is always sized to the load that it serves and the wire size it is supposed to protect.</p>

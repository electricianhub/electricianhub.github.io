<p>One of the first decisions you'll have to make it whether you want lights that are solar-powered or wired for electricity. Loop the far end of the wire back to the transformer to ensure both ends of the loop are powered, which also prevents the lights from going out if the wire is broken somewhere along its length, McGowan adds. Run those wires to the new permanently hot outlets. When purchasing a surge protection device, it is essential to consider the kind of equipment that you're protecting.</p>

<p>Even better, these units can be wired into your electrical system to automatically switch on when the grid loses power and automatically transfer back when the power comes on.

<p>Make sure the breaker to the switch is on in your breaker box and determine whether there are any other tripped outlets and switch them on as well. Home electrical fires or electrocutions injure or kill thousands of people in the U.S. every year. The average cost to replace a fuse box with a breaker panel is $1,100 to $4,000 and depends on what capacity the new breaker panel can handle. Home standby generators, always installed on the exterior of the home, come in various materials, but premium models may offer aluminum enclosures better suited to withstand high winds.</p>

Brian has designed the course to specifically meet the needs of electrical technicians, supervisors, managers and engineers who are directly responsible for the repair, maintenance and troubleshooting of industrial plant electrical equipment. Current electrical codes require circuits for each room and, in some cases separate circuits between lights and outlets due to arc fault and ground fault protection requirements in the current electrical code.</p>

<p>Make sure all 3-wired tools and appliances with flexible cords are properly grounded. There are some wiring systems out there that are actually better at conducting and are more efficient like fiber optics, but because of its wide availability copper wire still remains king. A good electrician has the required knowledge and experience to deal with electrical complications and therefore he is likely to be able to analyze the situation better and handle it accordingly.</p>

<p>If the light switch was improperly wired, it will get hot. According to the Centers for Disease Control, the most common injuries caused by contact with electrical energy are electric shock, burns, and falls. Because multiple conductors bundled in a cable cannot dissipate heat as easily as single insulated conductors, those circuits are always rated at a lower " ampacity ". Tables in electrical safety codes give the maximum allowable current based on size of conductor, voltage potential, insulation type and thickness, and the temperature rating of the cable itself.</p>

If you decide that you want to change out the panels in your house, it's a good idea to have professionals do the job for you. The very first possibility is to change some of the breakers in the panel.

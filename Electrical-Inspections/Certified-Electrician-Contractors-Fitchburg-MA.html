<p>Low voltage outdoor path lighting systems, which use 12-volt electrical circuits to power the lights, are wired, as opposed to solar systems. Similar to NM cable, UF cable is made up of three wires.

You'll now have a circuit breaker that will allow up to 20 amps of electricity to wiring that is only rated to be safe up to 15 amps.</p>
<p>Next, remove the screws that hold the old switches in place. And because the system operates on only 12 volts of electricity, it's completely safe for do-it-yourself installation.

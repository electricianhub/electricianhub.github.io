The two wires coming out of the wall would be connected to the two colors that are the same individually and the third wire gets connected to the odd colored that is coming out of the wall.

Power surges can happen to literally anybody and you want to be prepared when it happens to you. Choosing the right electrician for either a residential or commercial task is no small feat. You flip a switch — the lights turn on. You flip it again — off they go.

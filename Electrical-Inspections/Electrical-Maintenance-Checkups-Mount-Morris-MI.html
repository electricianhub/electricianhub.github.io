First and foremost of these reasons is their ability to use less power than other commercial lighting fixtures, making them very cost effective from an energy conservation perspective.</p>
<p>When you plug in a lamp and turn it on, the hot part of the outlet allows electricity to flow into the lamp, turning on the light bulb. Burning Smell or Overheating - If the panel looks like it's blackened or melted, you need to contact an electrician right away. As you can see, connecting a receptacle to the light would see the receptacle only hot when the light switch is on. When buildup does occur, shut off electrical equipment and unplug its power supply.</p>

Westinghouse WPro8500 is comparatively quieter than many other generators of this size.

As mentioned earlier, an engineer can perform a new load calculation allowing the reduction of the main circuit breaker to 150A and allowing you to add an 80A breaker for the PV system in the electrical panel. The Consumer Product Safety Commision estimates that 50 people die every year from accidental electrocutions involving residential wiring, panel boards, circuit breakers, and electrical outlets.</p>
<p>This clean power will not create fluctuation in electric power which occurs through traditional generators. After power returns, the generator shuts itself off and will turn back on should there ever be a power outage again. It automatically starts within seconds of detecting power loss, and runs on the home's existing natural gas or LP fuel supply. They know how to install top-quality lights correctly, so there are no unfortunate issues down the road that can cost you more in the long run.</p>
<p>Consult an electrician to learn whether your home's panel is still capable of providing the electricity you need or whether it's time to consider an upgrade. As a general rule houses are not supplied with enough power sockets or switches for additional lighting. Landscape fixtures are also available in LED, which will use far less power than traditional halogen or incandescent lighting.

All of our trained electrical contractor professionals are committed to delivering the same standards of quality to residential customers throughout all of our service areas. If your panel is warm, has a burnt smell, or burn marks, these are all signs of a prehistoric panel that is not equipped to handle the amount of power that is flowing through it. This can cause a server issue of a house fire and other home issues.</p>

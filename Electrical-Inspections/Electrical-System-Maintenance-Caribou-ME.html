In one NM cable, you'll usually find a hot wire, a ground wire, and a neutral wire. It is a little noisy under load but still quieter than a portable generator, and it does what it's designed to do - power your whole house.</p>

There are many different reasons to consider upgrading or replacing outdated switches and outlets.</p>

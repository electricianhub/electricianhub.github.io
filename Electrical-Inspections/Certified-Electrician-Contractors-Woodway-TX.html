<p>Doing electrical wiring by yourself can be tricky. Watch out: when mixing 14-3 and 14-2 wires on an electrical circuit.

A proper plastic covered wires- called NMC or Non Metallic Sheathed Cable- are so far considered the ideal one for indoor wiring. The cost of a sub-panel is usually less than a full-sized breaker panel due to its smaller size, lower amperage rating, and fewer circuit breakers. Electrical contractor licenses typically need to be renewed on an annual basis. In order to do this, you must have good wiring design (load-wise) and ensure power sources are situated around the property to allow all wire runs to be within 200' of the transformer.</p>
<p>Consult an electrician to learn whether your home's panel is still capable of providing the electricity you need or whether it's time to consider an upgrade. As a general rule houses are not supplied with enough power sockets or switches for additional lighting.

Many switches and receptacles have holes in the back of the device's body for making "stab-in" connections. Knob and tube upgrades - Knob and tube electrical systems are common in older homes. For example, in Florida, electrical contractors may be locally registered (by filing evidence of a current occupational license and compliance with local examination and licensing requirements) or state certified (by taking and passing the state licensing examination).</p>

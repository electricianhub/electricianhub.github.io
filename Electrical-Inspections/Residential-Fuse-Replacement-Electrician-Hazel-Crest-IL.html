<p>Basically, electrical wires are color coded to prevent wiring errors. Low voltage lighting is less permanent than standard line voltage lighting, which is quite difficult to re-arrange. More specifically, when electrical systems are damaged in a natural or man-made disaster, electricians need to make critical decisions about whether the electrical equipment that was damaged can be salvaged or not. Otherwise, frequent wiring issues, burnt bulbs, and other electrical problems that arise from faulty installations may burn a hole in your pocket.</p>

For commercial installs, we can set the generators to send diagnostic information to the IT department or another internal department via email or text.

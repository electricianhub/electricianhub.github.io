However, you may be able to shorten your apprenticeship by getting credit for some of the classroom hours from your pre-apprenticeship program.

<p>We are also equipped with whole house surge protection on our vehicles. You must have 4,000 hours of experience as a licensed unlimited journeyman. A surge can cause damage to your sensitive equipment such as computers or home theater systems. In addition to main electrical panel installation and circuit breaker repairs and additions, Allgood Electric can also add additional outlets so that you can run more electrical appliances, therefore improving the overall safety of your home.</p>

Sophisticated lighting schemes call for more switches. We offer a wide variety of electrical repairs such as: ceiling fan repairs, electrical troubelshooting, lighting repairs, outlet repairs, switch repairs, GFCI outlet repairs, GFCI breaker repairs and more. Using them for anything else will cause problems with inner wiring and will cause your electrical outlets to stop functioning properly.</p>

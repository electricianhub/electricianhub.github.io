<p>Your system is just as susceptible to increased voltage on these lines and therefore requires this type of protection. However, it does matter which black wires connect to which brass screws, which is why you should've marked them in previous steps. Individuals, families and businesses choose LED lights to save money on their energy bills as well as help the environment. Have us check your electrical panel to make sure it has enough power. Our electricians will address the simplest fixture or switch repair, all the way to complete underground wiring, rough-ins and trim-outs for new construction and remodels.</p>

<p>If you see any droppings or other signs of rodent activity in your attic, basement or around electrical fixtures, check all wiring in the area for signs of damage. The white wires always go on the silver terminals, so you will disconnect those and place them on the silver terminals, and here you have a bare copper wire, that bare copper wire is the ground.

If you're constantly tripping breakers then it might be time for an electrical inspection so the reason can be determined and the circuit breakers either replaced or upgraded to better handle the electrical load being placed on them.

<p>If your two plug ins (two electrical receptacles) are located in the same electrical box (we call this a "quad" electrical receptacle installation since each individual receptacle provides connections for two wall plugs), you'll want to wire the hot and neutral to one pair of screws on the first receptacle, and use short black and white jumper wires to connect the the proper terminals on the first receptacle to the second one in the same box. If the outlets ARE half hot, with one half of it switched, it will not be possible to reproduce that with the new outlets.</p>

Standard wall outlet codes have not changed much, but outlets that are at eye level or in areas of the home that use water have been upgraded over the last few decades.</p>
<p>If you live in an older home, you may have outlets that don't have a third or grounded” hole.

I chose to break off the little tab on the hot side of the receptacle to make half of it switched and the other half always powered.

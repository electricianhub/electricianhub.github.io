<p>The National Electrical Code (NEC) and local building codes regulate the types of wire and cable that can be used in specific electrical applications, as well as the manner of installation. Instead, splice the neutrals from the feed to the GFCI and the under-sink outlet together, splice a short jumper to the black feed to the GFCI, and connect that jumper to a new switch.

<p>In most jurisdictions, a master electrician license would allow you to bid jobs and offer your services independently to the public. And if you are not sure what a wire is connected to, just turn the breaker off, disconnect the wire and put a wago or a nut at the end of it and turn the circuit back on and see what is not working. After that time you expose yourself to potential electrical dangers by overloading your system with the latest electrical equipment.</p>
<p>The exception here is if the outlet that's controlled by the light switch is only connected to that light switch and there aren't any other wires. Here's what electrical cable looks like inside. Oftentimes, the light problem isn't from the light fixture itself, but from the light switch.

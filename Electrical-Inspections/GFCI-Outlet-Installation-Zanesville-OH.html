If a property is experiencing flickering lights, frequently blown circuits, or malfunctioning outlets, the electrical panel may need be inspected, especially if it is determined there are no wiring issues or issues with electrical appliances.

<p>The National Electrical Code (NEC) and local building codes regulate the types of wire and cable that can be used in specific electrical applications, as well as the manner of installation. Instead, splice the neutrals from the feed to the GFCI and the under-sink outlet together, splice a short jumper to the black feed to the GFCI, and connect that jumper to a new switch. If necessary, remove all the wires but one, check the outlet for power, and then use a different wire.</p>
<p>When there's only one cable entering an outlet box, it means the outlet is the last fixture on the circuit. You can also substitute up to 1 year of work experience for completion of a 2-year, post-high school course in electrical technology and passing an exam.

DO NOT connect wrong outlet to voltage, or risk burning out electrical load.</p>

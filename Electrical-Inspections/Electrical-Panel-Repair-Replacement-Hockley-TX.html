The T method would be a group of 6 or 10 (or so) connected in a daisy chain with #12's (not the #16 or #18 that comes with the fixture) then a #12 or #10 home run brought from the center fixture of that group to the transformer. For example, if outdoor entertaining is not important then lighting the patio area and creating paths of light can be omitted.</p>

<p>For each home, wiring and electrical systems, along with specific devices, were carefully inspected. Tip: Bend the connecting wires before pushing the switch or outlet into the junction box so that they fold in behind the switch or outlet and then insert the mounting screws to secure it in place.

<p>Homeowners all around the country are starting to use more and more solar landscape lighting in an effort to beautify their homes while reducing their energy consumption.

Be smart, plan ahead and schedule one of our tune-ups to ensure that your generator is always ready to keep you safe and comfortable anytime power goes off.

Accent: Accent lights are smaller light fixtures used to light certain areas of your home. A fuse is designed to stop sudden large electric currents from damaging the equipment in your house.</p>
<p>Replacing the lighting fixtures or lights in your home with more energy efficient models can have a big impact on your electrical bill.

<p>With an increased reliance on both data collection and machinery run by computer software, electrical maintenance is more vital than ever. Lighten up your place with right light fixtures. Your project actually begins at the electrical supply panel, which is also commonly referred to as a breaker box or fuse box. A whole house generator should be placed in a place that is easy to access for repair and maintenance.

The neutral wires and the ground wire will stay put. Certainly, it can be extremely dangerous if you are not familiar with electrical wiring.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for helping, I found where the main power comes from and it's hooked to the GFI that's next to the switch, so I did a pigtail of the (hot) black wire to the switch and then the other black wire that runs from the outlet from underneath the sink to the other bronze screw on the switch. Depending on application, proper installation requires meeting noise, fuel storage, building and electrical codes, and emission ordinances. Upon sensing the return to the utility power source, the generator automatically shuts down and returns to standby mode.</p>

If there's no neutral in the box, shop for a smart switch that doesn't require a neutral. Most standby generators make use of new technologies that muffle sound to residential-friendly levels.

<p>Take a look at how the outlet is wired up. You'll notice that there are two black wires connected to the outlet on one side and two white wires on the other side, as well as a bare copper wire connected to a green screw. This shows that the old electrical wiring isn't up to the task to properly power the items inside your home. For example, by installing low voltage outdoor lighting, you can add a feature to your home that will be visually pleasing and help you keep money in your pockets.</p>

While the entire duplex outlet could be turned on via a wall switch, only one of the two plug-ins is usually switched; this leaves the other half permanently powered for other uses.</p>

<p>Look in the fuse box or breaker box and see what rating the fuse is set at, look on the outer sheathing on the wire and see what its rating is. If you are continually resetting breakers or replacing fuses then there is likely to be a fault and more current is trying to be drawn than the circuit is designed for.

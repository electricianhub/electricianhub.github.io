Our homes totally rely on electric energy to supply us with food, light, entertainment, heating and cooling. The arc does not have to reach ground wire, it can merely be a loose Hot or Neutral located on a switch screw, outlet, fan motor etc.</p>
<p>Different surge protectors are being sold in the market. Line voltage lighting systems run on the same power which runs your house (120 volts) and, therefore, requires the expertise of an electrical contractor to install.

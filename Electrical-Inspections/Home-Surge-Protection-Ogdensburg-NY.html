<p>Before a contractor's licence can be issued, the applicant must have held an Electrical Mechanic's Licence for at least two years. When working properly the electricity is fed through the positive wire into a load, such as an appliance, then it returns to the electrical panel via the neutral wire.

A power surge is something that can happen for a number of reasons, the main one being a lightning strike.</p>
<p>Electrical surges are a nightmare for everyone. Our team of electricians is licensed to provide quality care for the safety of your family, property and belongings. Others only offer low-level surge suppression, leaving them powerless to block appliance-damaging surges. Low voltage lighting cables usually allow for direct burial of the cable without conduit (direct burial should be listed on the packaging). The average home typically requires 200 amp panels to fully operate all of your appliances and meet your electrical needs.</p>

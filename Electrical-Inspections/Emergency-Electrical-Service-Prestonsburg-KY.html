That leaves you with two wires - one old and the new 6" piece - to go to the switch.</p>
<p>If your two plug ins (two electrical receptacles) are located in the same electrical box (we call this a "quad" electrical receptacle installation since each individual receptacle provides connections for two wall plugs), you'll want to wire the hot and neutral to one pair of screws on the first receptacle, and use short black and white jumper wires to connect the the proper terminals on the first receptacle to the second one in the same box. If the outlets ARE half hot, with one half of it switched, it will not be possible to reproduce that with the new outlets.</p>

The national average to replace or upgrade an electric panel is right at $1,100, and upgrades regularly cost $500 - $1,500.

<p>If your home is more than 20 years old, has constant problems with flickering lights or tripped breakers, or constant electrical failures, chances are it needs a service upgrade.

Thankfully, there is an economical solution available: whole-home surge protection, a breaker added to your main electrical panel by a Lee Company certified electrician.</p>
<p>If you live in an older home, you may have outlets that don't have a third or grounded” hole. This is especially important if you have small children in the house; you'll want to keep all of the electrical outlets covered. Remember that even if an appliance is off” if it is still plugged in, it is still connected to electricity, therefore a potential shock hazard. Some electrical contractors specialize in maintenance and repair. At the same time electronics devices need the maximum protection that is available.</p>
<p>Turn off the main circuit breaker before working on the electrical service panel. I would recommend "Electrician on Call" to anyone, requiring electrical related needs. The hot hole is connected to the wire that supplies the electrical current. A unit generating 20 kilowatts can easily power the average home, and you may not need to forego the microwave popcorn or even turn down the AC. It depends on the size of the home and power needs; a 5000-watt portable unit might be better for an RV or small cottage.</p>

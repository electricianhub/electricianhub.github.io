Upgrading the electrical panel should be your very last option. The Standard for Luminaires, UL 1598, covers safety requirements for luminaries, however, low-voltage lighting systems are covered by specific safety standards for the low-voltage aspects of these systems.

Regarding the voltage difference, when I mentioned I checked the voltage in an outlet, note that it wasn't the switched outlet but another outlet in same room. Use wiring that is made for outdoor use and always install weatherproof receptacles and boxes.

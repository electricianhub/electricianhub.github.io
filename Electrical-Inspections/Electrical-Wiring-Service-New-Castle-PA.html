<h2>How To Hire Licensed Electrician in New Castle</h2>
<p>Doing electrical wiring by yourself can be tricky. Watch out: when mixing 14-3 and 14-2 wires on an electrical circuit.

<p>Automatic standby generators are complex machines designed to work in emergency situations. In the event of a blackout, there is a specific kind of surge protector that can prevent loss of important information by acting as a storage cell for power, giving you enough time to save your work and power down your machine. Most sensitive electronic equipment (i.e. televisions, stereos, computers, faxes, printers, etc.) may not tolerate that voltage and will require a second line of defense provided by a point-of-use surge arrestor”.</p>
<p>Malfunctioning electric service can cause voltage drop on both Hot wires or either Hot wire. Turn the electricity back on and if it was the switch or outlet that was faulty, your light and outlet should work properly.

<p>If your two plug ins (two electrical receptacles) are located in the same electrical box (we call this a "quad" electrical receptacle installation since each individual receptacle provides connections for two wall plugs), you'll want to wire the hot and neutral to one pair of screws on the first receptacle, and use short black and white jumper wires to connect the the proper terminals on the first receptacle to the second one in the same box. If the outlets ARE half hot, with one half of it switched, it will not be possible to reproduce that with the new outlets.</p>

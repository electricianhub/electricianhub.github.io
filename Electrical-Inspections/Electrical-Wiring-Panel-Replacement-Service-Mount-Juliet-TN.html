<p>In most jurisdictions, a master electrician license would allow you to bid jobs and offer your services independently to the public. And if you are not sure what a wire is connected to, just turn the breaker off, disconnect the wire and put a wago or a nut at the end of it and turn the circuit back on and see what is not working.

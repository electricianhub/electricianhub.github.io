Seriously consider hiring an electrician who will allow you to do lots of the mundane work such as nailing up the boxes, running the cables between them, and even allowing you to connect up many of the switches and outlets after the drywall is up.

<p>We have professionally trained, clean cut, respectful technicians who are well-equipped to troubleshoot any electrical issue, including complex problems. Extension cords are only for temporary use. Circuit breakers last a long time so you should check your other options before deciding that issue is a faulty breaker.

<p>Tell an adult to pull the plug from the outlet or turn off the power at the fuse box or circuit breaker. If a property is experiencing flickering lights, frequently blown circuits, or malfunctioning outlets, the electrical panel may need be inspected, especially if it is determined there are no wiring issues or issues with electrical appliances. It seems like it would be easier to convert the outlet to always-on, cap the wires, and install a wireless remote wall mount that could control the smart light switch I might add in place of the current dimmer.</p>

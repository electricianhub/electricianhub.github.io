Portable generators can handle brief power outages; they are capable of powering your essential appliances during an outage. Because LEDs run on low power, back-up batteries for lighting systems can generate light for a longer time than a traditional system, or can provide more light from a smaller battery. Constant voltage will power LED arrays with a steady voltage regardless of current.</p>
<p>A professional landscape lighting installation is as important as good design. Note where the white (neutral), black (power), and green or bare copper (ground) wires are attached on the existing outlet.

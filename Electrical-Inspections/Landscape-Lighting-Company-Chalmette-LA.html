The result of a properly installed system is a beautifully illuminated landscape and a safe installation.

Inconsistent Power - When you're noticing the outlet's only giving you power sometimes, this might mean that the wiring is bad or there's another type of electrical issue. Because of low voltage lightings reputation for being a safe and effective system when properly installed, it is taken for granted by some and the basic safety precautions normally taken when working with voltage that can kill you are not always followed.</p>

For over 35 years now, our team of Birmingham electricians have been providing local home and business owners alike with the fast and reliable electrical services they need to keep their properties functioning safely, effectively, and efficiently at all times.</p>
<p>We all use lighting daily, here are some safety tips to remember when the lighting goes out and you need to replace the bulb. I have not done a significant low-voltage wiring project in quite a few years, so I decided to do a bit of reading. With the versatility of education in many electrician and electrical programs at Ontario colleges, you can choose to jump-start your career or spend time learning a specialty. Master electricians are responsible for all electrical work performed under their supervision.</p>

If you have any damaged electrical equipment at your home, contact Hamilton's favourite licensed electricians at Stack Electric and have them repaired. Likewise, if some adults in your household are of a more petite stature that prevents them from easily accessing a light switch positioned 48 inches off the ground, consider reducing the height to something lower within the ADA-acceptable range that they can more comfortably reach.</p>

You can be fined $22,000 as an individual or $110,000 as a company for doing unlicensed electrical work. A training licence is valid for the period of apprenticeship or traineeship.

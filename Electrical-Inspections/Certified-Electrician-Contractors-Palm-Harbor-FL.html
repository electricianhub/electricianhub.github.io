<p>Attach each electrical wire to the appropriate terminals on each side and tighten the screws securely. From bright light for working to soothing low levels of lighting to relax, installation of dimmers and recessed lighting can make a great difference in how your room looks and feels. Low voltage lighting requires a transformer to reduce the voltage to below 50 volts, most commonly 12 volts or 24 volts. Your home has different types of electrical circuits installed that serve different purposes.</p>

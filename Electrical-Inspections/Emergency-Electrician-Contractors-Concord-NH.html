<p>Consult an electrician to learn whether your home's panel is still capable of providing the electricity you need or whether it's time to consider an upgrade. As a general rule houses are not supplied with enough power sockets or switches for additional lighting. Landscape fixtures are also available in LED, which will use far less power than traditional halogen or incandescent lighting. Electrical panels have evolved over time, and many designs that were common in the mid-20th century no longer meet contemporary electrical needs.</p>

<h3>Remodeling Electrical Contractor in Concord NH</h3>
<p>If you plan on buying individual lights or if you plan on buying a kit, here is one important question you need to ask yourself: "How will the transformer turn on and off?" Most likely you don't live in an area of the world where the sun rises and sets at the same time each day, so I recommend buying a transformer that has a photocell light sensor, the light sensor turns your outdoor lighting on at dusk and then it should have some sort of control so you can adjust how long the lights will stay on for.</p>

Then you will use a similar item known as a Quick Connector to fasten the laid-out cable to each light fixture. And also, for your safety, throw off the master switch for the fuse box, just to be sure you don't get shocked when putting in the new one.</p>

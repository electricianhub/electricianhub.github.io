<p>Basically, electrical wires are color coded to prevent wiring errors. Low voltage lighting is less permanent than standard line voltage lighting, which is quite difficult to re-arrange. More specifically, when electrical systems are damaged in a natural or man-made disaster, electricians need to make critical decisions about whether the electrical equipment that was damaged can be salvaged or not.

Another helpful thing you can do is install surge protectors. Even if you were to upgrade your electrical panel on your own, that in and of itself won't increase the power supply to your home.</p>

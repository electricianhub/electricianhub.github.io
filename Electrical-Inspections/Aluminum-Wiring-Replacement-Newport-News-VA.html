Most homeowner associations frown on permanently installed generators, so be sure you're not creating a problem for yourself there.</p>
<p>If you want a whole house generator that can power 90-100% of your home on natural gas or propane, call a pro from the start. Plugging too many items into outlets is the cause of many house fires.

<p>Having identified your power source and have cut the opening for your new outlet you are ready to begin wiring. On average, permanent standby generators produce anywhere from 5,000 to 20,000 watts depending upon the model you choose for your home's electrical needs. Some electricians say that if the wires are touched or disturbed in any way the entire wiring needs to be replaced. If the power goes out, an electronic switch automatically signals the unit to turn on, keeping essential household systems and appliances running even if you're miles away.</p>
<p>Code § SPS 305.40 , the electrical wiring activities that may be undertaken by a person who holds a license or registration as a licensed Residential Master Electrician, a licensed Residential Journeyman Electrician or a registered Residential Electrical Apprentice shall be limited to wiring associated with dwellings, dwelling units and detached accessory buildings and structures serving the dwellings or the dwelling units, such as garages, carports, gazebos, and swimming pools.</p>
<p>Look in the fuse box or breaker box and see what rating the fuse is set at, look on the outer sheathing on the wire and see what its rating is. If you are continually resetting breakers or replacing fuses then there is likely to be a fault and more current is trying to be drawn than the circuit is designed for.

<p>Purchasing inexpensive home standby generators will entirely depend on a number of things. The second method of wiring middle-of-run receptacles is to connect them to the circuit wires via "pigtails." A pigtail is a short length of wire that runs from a hot or neutral screw terminal on the receptacle to the circuit wires, which are joined together in the outlet box with a wire connector. In the diagram, the black is hot, the white is neutral is white, and the brown looking wire is a bare copper ground.

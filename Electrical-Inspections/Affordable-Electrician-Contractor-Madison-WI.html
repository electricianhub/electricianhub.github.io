<p>Although they all may look the same when installed, the various light switches function in different ways and are wired differently. You can double check to ensure that it was turned off by flipping the switch in an attempt to operate a light, and by using a voltage tester once the switch plate is removed to confirm that the wires are not charged. The existing electrical panel is in code violation and moving the panel is simply the easiest way to solve the problem.</p>

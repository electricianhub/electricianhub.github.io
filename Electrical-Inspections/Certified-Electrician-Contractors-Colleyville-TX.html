<p>Others leave licensing requirements entirely to local governments. Many manufacturers integrate the PV cell to the light fixtures. Your hardwired lighting, HVAC system, and anything plugged into that circuit of wiring can get fried too. Make sure you review this article to see how all the connections should be made, including ground wires. Running a unit too close to its rated output reduces fuel efficiency and makes the engine run harder.

<p>I found continuity between it and the white wire leaving the outlet.

In a common surge protector, there's a component known as MOV or metal oxide varistor, which diverts extra voltage and prevents damage to the electronic.</p>
<p>Many models are given a rating of 62 decibels which is similar to most of the portable inverter generators reviewed , but that is often the noise level measured at 25 feet away.

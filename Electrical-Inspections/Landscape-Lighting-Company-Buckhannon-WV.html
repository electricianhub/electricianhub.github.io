Electrical conduit is also sold in a flexible metal design that should not be confused with BX or Greenfield armored cable: this flexible metal conduit looks like BX or armored cable but is sold "empty".

<p>Installation is simple; just use the real metal stake to install each light into the ground in the perfect location. And if more than 15 amps flows through the circuit, the breaker trips. The transfer switch automatically starts the generator, which powers the circuits in the subpanel. In commercial and industrial settings, electrical contractors work on large projects in office buildings, schools, hospitals, as well as factories, assembly plants and distribution centers, among many others.</p>

Never place surge protectors or their power supply cords under a rug or someplace they could experience wear and tear from being stepped on. And don't staple or tack their power cords to anything.

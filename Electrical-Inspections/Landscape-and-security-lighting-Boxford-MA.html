<p>Circuit breakers protect the electrical circuits in your home by stopping the flow of electricity if there's an overload or other electrical fault. A Generac managed whole-house generator manages the power requirements of each of your individual appliances.

They also do not have a main breaker switch to stop all power from flowing into the panel.</p>

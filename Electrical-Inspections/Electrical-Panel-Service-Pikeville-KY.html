Electricity flows through the hot wire, entering the switch and then into the light fixture, and then returns back through the neutral wire. A power surge will travel through any wire into a house, leaving common appliances and sensitive electronic equipment vulnerable to serious damage. This approach is general in nature allowing it to be used on any type of electrical circuit.</p>

Tracing electrical wiring in walls can be tricky, and it involves more than just looking for the wires themselves.

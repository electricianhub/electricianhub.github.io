Cords under rugs pose a tripping hazard and can overheat, while furniture can crush cord insulation and damage wires.

In your switch box you should have one or more grounding conductors spliced together with a wire connector or wire crimp.</p>

With today's reliance on electrical appliances, many homes are not capable of handling the amount of power needed solve that problem by letting Canaan Tech Mechanical upgrade your main electrical panel.

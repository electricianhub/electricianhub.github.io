<p>Common sense safety practices save lives and property. According to the International Association of Certified Home Inspectors (InterNACHI), you should make regular checks to your electric panel, even if you haven't needed to undertake any electrical fixes. Inspect all your home's light switches and outlets. These are some of the most prominently featured specifications which define a surge protector for AC mains, as well as for some data communications protection applications.

Before you install your lights, you'll need a transformer that suits your project.</p>

If you add an addition onto your home or office, let a licensed electrician ensure that all of your new wiring is done correctly to prevent power distribution issues.

Most homeowner associations frown on permanently installed generators, so be sure you're not creating a problem for yourself there.</p>
<p>You can buy standby or portable generators depending upon the power needs for your home.

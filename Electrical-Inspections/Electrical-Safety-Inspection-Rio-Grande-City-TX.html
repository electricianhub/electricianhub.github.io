<p>It quickly entered the consumer sector by manufacturing electric fans and by 1960, emerged as one of the biggest suppliers of electrical equipment. A circuit breaker is an automatically operated electrical switch designed to protect an electrical circuit from damage caused by excess current from an overload or short circuit. Instead, you should have your older circuit panels replaced immediately in exchange for more modern and code-compliant circuit panels.

<p>If the light switch is in the on position, and you touch the wrong parts of the light bulb, while removing and replacing it, you could find yourself getting a nice jolt of electricity through your body. If you have electronics plugged into power strips, make sure they have surge protection as well (not all power strips do!).

<p>Whether your home is already struggling to keep up with demand or you are renovating or planning an addition, panel upgrades are necessary to power additional circuits. Prints, drawings, and schematics are useful in determining the location of equipment, identifying its components, and specifying the proper sequence of operation.

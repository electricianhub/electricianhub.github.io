Advances in technology have resulted in portable generators with power output levels similar to stationary generators giving them a wide range of uses. Standby generators often run on propane, natural gas, or a combination of fuels. We take pride in the diversity of our commercial lighting offerings.

<p>This is the key to ensuring that your generator will perform when you need it the most and will not let you down upon the next power outage. Don't splice equipment cords to repair damage or to extend the original length.

Circuit breakers are designed to trip when overloaded or when there is a short circuit or electrical problem. Use a portable ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) cord if your outdoor outlets don't have GFCIs.</p>

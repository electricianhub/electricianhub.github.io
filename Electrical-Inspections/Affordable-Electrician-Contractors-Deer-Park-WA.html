<p>Employers of Residential Electricians Across the U.S. Fuses are made from pieces of metal that melt when overheated so that they no longer work while circuit breakers have internal switch mechanisms that trip when there is an unsafe surge of electricity.

Ambient light from the spotlights you do use can also illuminate and create an interplay of light and shadow of nearby plants and foliage.

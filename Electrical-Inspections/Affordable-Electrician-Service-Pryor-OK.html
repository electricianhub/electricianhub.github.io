A standby generator is viewed as an appliance that reduces the chance that you will submit an insurance claim because it can prevent damages from occurring when the power is out (like frozen pipes or basement flood damage).</p>
<p>In fact, many families choose to install generators for their homes Sometimes even a minor storm can knock power out. 120V or 240V devices and the wiring supplying them are normally protected from overcurrent at an electrical panel or sub-panel using 120V or two-pole 240V breakers matched to the circuit wire size, such as 15A for #14 copper wire circuits, 20A for #12 copper wire circuits. Natural gas is rarely interrupted in most places, but you'll also require a plumber to come out and make sure that your generator is hooked up safely to the line in addition to an electrician.</p>

<p>A plus for running propane over NG is that you will get the full 20KW out of the genset rather than a 20% reduction (e.g. 18KW) using NG.

Breakers Won't Remain Reset: If you notice that a reset circuit breaker in your electrical panel won't stay reset or restore power, then it's very likely that you have a faulty service panel.</p>

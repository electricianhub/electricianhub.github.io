The 8 and 10 gauge wire is mainly used to extend the distance from the transformer to your first fixture on that run. If you notice that your lights dim when you use appliances such as a microwave or hair dryer, that is an indicator that your breaker panel is in need of repairs.</p>
<p>Plan on obtaining a variety of licenses if you want to be an electrical contractor. Your electrician will know how to tackle even the most complicated of tasks, such as installing dimmer switch systems or hanging light fixtures. After taking the assessment, respondents are directed to ESFI's comprehensive library of safety resources and links to help them find the information to take the next step in improving the electrical safety of their workplace. In this illustration, you can see the red hot lead” wires of the dimmer are connected to the inbound black wire from the electrical source (the electrical panel) and the black wire that goes to the light fixture's black wire which, in this case, is a white wire that has been taped with black electrical tape.</p>

<p>Homeowners with older homes are much more likely to require this type of work, and most realize that their electrical inexperience is too great to make this a do-it-yourself home repair.

Load side transformer wires tend to be the same color and only connections from the transformer to the main are different insulation colors to denote the hot from the neutral wire.

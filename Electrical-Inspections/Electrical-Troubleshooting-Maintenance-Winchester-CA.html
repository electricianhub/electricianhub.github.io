Load side transformer wires tend to be the same color and only connections from the transformer to the main are different insulation colors to denote the hot from the neutral wire. Whereas a portable generator can only run a few of your electrical devices, a standby generator has enough juice to power your entire home - this includes your lights, appliances, and even entertainment devices.</p>

<p>For example, a 300-watt transformer can power 100 feet of 16-gauge cable, or 150 feet of 14-gauge cable, or 200 feet of 12-gauge cable. Power surges can happen to literally anybody and you want to be prepared when it happens to you. Choosing the right electrician for either a residential or commercial task is no small feat. You flip a switch — the lights turn on. You flip it again — off they go. The internal workings that create that light can come from a complex system of light switch wiring — especially in older construction that may not be up to modern code.</p>
<p>We carry a large selection of lighting fixtures in our showroom. Exceeding expectations is our primary goal, and it's our hope that in doing so, our clients will come back to us time and again for all of their electrical service needs.

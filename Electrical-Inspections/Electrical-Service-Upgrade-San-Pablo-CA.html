<p>Every day installers, integrators, engineers and electricians count on Ditek Surge Protection Devices (SPDs) to safeguard their fire panels, video surveillance systems, network devices, burglar alarms, access control systems and AC power. Once a backup generator is installed, a homeowner does not need to worry about being stuck in the freezing cold or dark again.

The controller is faulty if there are no voltmeter readings on all three of the terminal pairs. The generator is paired with a transfer switch containing a predetermined number of circuits based on the generator's kW power rating. Damaged power cords are a serious residential electrical safety risk, and they are capable of causing both fires and electrocution.</p>

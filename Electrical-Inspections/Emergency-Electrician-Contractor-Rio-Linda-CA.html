Depending on the severity of these issues, if not properly repaired, it can lead to electrical shocks or even possible fire threats in your home in Knoxville, Tennessee. Loop - This is a series run but instead of ending the wire at the last fixture, you arrange it so the wiring comes full circle, making a big loop” back to the transformer.

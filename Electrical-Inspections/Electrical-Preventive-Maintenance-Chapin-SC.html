In some instances, such as some switch legs, the function of the wires will be indicated by colored electrical tape.</p>
<p>While only lasting for a few microseconds, lightning causes a dangerous voltage surge that can destroy your electronic devices. But lightning is by no means the major cause of power surges. Over time, light switches will wear out.

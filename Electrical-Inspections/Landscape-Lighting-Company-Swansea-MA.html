<p>Maintenance work varies in different ways and it usually depends on where an electrical technician works. Lights flickering, warm to the touch receptacles, and any noticeable odor such as, the smell of burning plastic should be inspected by a licensed electrician. The power is reliably there and immediately so. Connecting lighting fixtures to low voltage is similar to connecting a garden hose nozzle to the end of a garden hose. A more recent addition to the homeowner electrical safety checklist is tamper-resistant outlets. So, if your fixtures are each eighteen watts and you have ten of them, that is 180 watts for your transformer and 25% more for the wire.</p>

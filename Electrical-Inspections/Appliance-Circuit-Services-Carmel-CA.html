In the event of a blackout, there is a specific kind of surge protector that can prevent loss of important information by acting as a storage cell for power, giving you enough time to save your work and power down your machine. Most sensitive electronic equipment (i.e. televisions, stereos, computers, faxes, printers, etc.) may not tolerate that voltage and will require a second line of defense provided by a point-of-use surge arrestor‚Äù.</p>

<p>Labeling - If you are keen enough, you will find that electrical wires have letters on them. A benefit of something like an in-line coaxial surge protector, as opposed to traditional a surge protector, is that it can also store vital data concerning the power output of the specific equipment that it protects.

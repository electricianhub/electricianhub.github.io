Surge protectors will indeed protect computers and other electronic devices from power surges and most distant lightning strikes, but they can't prevent a direct lighting strike from causing damage to connected devices. Low voltage landscape lighting wire or landscape lighting cable as it is often referred as, is made of multi-strands of copper wire that are bound together. According to the EFSi, arcing faults cause more than 30,000 home fires each year in the US alone, resulting in hundreds of deaths and injuries - atop more than $750 million in property damage.</p>

Be sure to include all landscape features, buildings, individual light fixtures, and power supplies in your drawing.</p>
<p>Lighting can hide obvious landscape problems while accentuating positive features. They use different types of hand and power tools, such as conduit benders, to run and protect wiring.

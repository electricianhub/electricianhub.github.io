<p>A lot of us keep a generator around for those occasions where some extra power might be warranted, but a home standby generator isn't just a little piece for handling a couple of extra rooms. Never place surge protectors or their power supply cords under a rug or someplace they could experience wear and tear from being stepped on. And don't staple or tack their power cords to anything.

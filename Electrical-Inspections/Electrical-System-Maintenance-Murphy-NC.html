<h2>How To Hire Licensed Electrician Service in Murphy</h2>
<p>When it comes to power surges, you can never be too careful. On top of that, our electricians guarantee that they'll be on time for your appointment. It plugs into a GFCI-protected outdoor electrical outlet and steps down the house current from 120 volts to 12 volts. The amendment specifies the use of new cable colours for all new fixed wiring electrical installations in the UK. These new colours are sometimes referred to as Harmonized colours. If there is no ground wire at the house wiring, then a three prong outlet should not be installed.</p>
<p>When an outage occurs, the switch is triggered (usually automatically in the case of an automatic transfer switch, but some models require a manual switch flip) and switches from utility power to the generator, which turns on automatically when the switch engages. Since a traditional knob and tube electrical circuit lacks a ground wire, these circuits should be upgraded to new wire whenever possible. An electrician can help make wiring a light switch hassle-free.</p>

Research by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics shows the median income for electricians in 2017 was $54,110. A common misconception is that surge protectors always protect against lightning, which can create sudden and increased electrical pressure (thousands of volts or greater). An electrician can advise you about how much power your home really needs.</p>

When the automatic transfer switch senses that the generator is running and producing power it automatically disconnects the utility power line and reconnects to the generator power line, providing emergency power to your a home or building within seconds of a sudden power outage.</p>
<p>Continuing education, including courses that offer unique certifications, can not only keep electricians up-to-date, but can look very nice on a resume.

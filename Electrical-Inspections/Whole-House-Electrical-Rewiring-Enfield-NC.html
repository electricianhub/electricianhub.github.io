Lightning may strike at any moment, causing a power surge that could damage or destroy your TV, personal computer and other everyday electrical appliances in your home. A service panel distributes electricity throughout a building. Electrical systems used in older homes weren't designed to handle today's electrical demands with things like home entertainment systems, computers, and home security systems.</p>
<p>When the safety device is actuated (when the door comes in contact with an object during downward travel), the circuit will cause the motor to step and reverse the door to the fully open position. With the generator running, the switch closed, and the voltmeter probes attached to the current conductor and neutral conductor connections of the motor, the voltmeter will indicate the voltage potential at the motor.

LEDs are highly sensitive to changes both in voltage and current, so if you are dealing with low voltage LED lights, wire-wound, stabilized transformers are the safe solution.</p>
<p>The Chicago Tribune reported on an electrical fire that caused thousands of dollars of damage in June 2016 in Elgin, Ill. If the plug or light switch or whatever you're working on still works, turn it on. Go to the breaker panel and start turning off breakers one at a time until you get the right one.

<p>One of the first decisions you'll have to make it whether you want lights that are solar-powered or wired for electricity. Loop the far end of the wire back to the transformer to ensure both ends of the loop are powered, which also prevents the lights from going out if the wire is broken somewhere along its length, McGowan adds. Run those wires to the new permanently hot outlets. When purchasing a surge protection device, it is essential to consider the kind of equipment that you're protecting.</p>

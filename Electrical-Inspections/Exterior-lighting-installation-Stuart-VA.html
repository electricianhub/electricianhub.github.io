<p>Standby generators - A standby generator is permanently installed outside your home, and usually runs on propane or natural gas. The electrical panel box is usually installed alongside the electric meter.

Electrical surges can damage computer equipment by burning its wires or gradually over time wearing down the device's internal components and even wipe out any saved data.</p>
<p>With generators, the type of fuel used also matters as it will determine everything from how much it will cost to operate to its environment-friendliness. And even if your electrical panel doesn't seem like an immediate threat right now, it is still recommended that it be checked and potentially replaced before future problems occur. Should you have any doubts regarding the condition of your electrical wiring system, it is necessary to schedule electrical wiring inspection services with a professional electrician.</p>
<p>Replacing damaged appliances and electronics can cost thousands of dollars. Liquid-cooled - These generators can handle prolonged outage periods as they are typically liquid-cooled. These cables were similar to underground telegraph and telephone cables of the time.

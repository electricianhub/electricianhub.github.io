<p>If the incoming ground wire from the feed circuit was left long enough, it can be run continuously, connected to a grounding screw that connects the wire to the metal junction box (skip this step if plastic junction boxes are in use), on to the ground screw terminal at each electrical receptacle, and ending with a ground clamp crimp connector that ties the incoming ground to the ground wire of the outgoing wire that continues to the next junction box.</p>
<p>Tip: If a project calls for longer lengths of wire (such as 80 or more feet from the breaker), increase the gauge size to ensure that enough electricity can pass through it. We specialize in comprehensive electrical wiring services for every aspect of your residential or commercial property. Your first step in adding backup power is deciding what you need (or want) to keep running when the electricity goes out. Our expert installers seamlessly integrate your generator into your home or business electrical network, thoroughly test your system, and stand behind your unit after the sale.</p>

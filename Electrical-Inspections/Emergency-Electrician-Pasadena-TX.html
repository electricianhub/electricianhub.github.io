<h2>How To Hire Licensed Electrician in Pasadena</h2>
<p>How many of us have waited until our computer, television, or other electrical apparatus was zapped by a rogue current and it resulted in replacement or repair due to an electrical surge? If you find that you have one particular circuit that seems to inexplicably shut off, even with no significant electrical load on it, then you may need to replace a faulty breaker. Always best to disconnect power, but issues of insulation failure, lack of proper grounding, lack of GFCI, out-of-code wiring, generator operating without transfer switch, and other problems pose a risk to anyone working on electric power. Licensed electrician requirements also dictate proper insurance coverage - including Worker's Compensation, liability, and property damage.</p>

Describe the two main types of lighting circuits and their differences.

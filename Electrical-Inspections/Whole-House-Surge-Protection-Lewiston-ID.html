As a rule of thumb, electric panels need replacing every 25-40 years, so if your home is that age, there's a likelihood that you will need to upgrade.</p>
<p>For example, if you are primarily concerned about keeping your refrigerator functioning during the utility power downtime, an inverter generator can do the trick.

<p>A licensed electrician can check your electrical panel, tighten any wires that need it, and even use an infrared tester to identify which circuit breakers are getting too hot in the fuse box. To be up to code and ensure you're not potentially endangering power workers, you should run the generator into a power transfer switch. The American Red Cross recommends permanently installed backup generators as a safer way to provide backup power to a home than a portable generator.</p>

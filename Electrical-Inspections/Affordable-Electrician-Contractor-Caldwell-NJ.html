Get an electrical engineer to estimate how much amperage you need to add before planning to install central heat and air or new appliances such as an electric range, a dryer, and others, which use 240-volt power. This is useful to check that there is no current flow through the wire (the circuit is dead) before you start to dismantle the old switch.</p>

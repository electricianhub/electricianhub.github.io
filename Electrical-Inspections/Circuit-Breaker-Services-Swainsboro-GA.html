<p>There are a few smart light switches that don't require neutral wires, but they are cost-prohibitive and harder to come across. Your home and safety are too important to use a non licensed electrician. You pay a substantial price for the convenience of a permanently installed generator, and that price increases substantially as output goes up. It starts at about $3,000 for the 6- to 8-kw models and reaches from $5,000 to $10,000 for the 11- to 20-kw units. The variety of light fixtures and lighting accessories has grown exponentially.</p>

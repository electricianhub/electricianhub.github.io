<p>Maintenance work varies in different ways and it usually depends on where an electrical technician works. Lights flickering, warm to the touch receptacles, and any noticeable odor such as, the smell of burning plastic should be inspected by a licensed electrician.

Upgrading the electrical panel should be your very last option.

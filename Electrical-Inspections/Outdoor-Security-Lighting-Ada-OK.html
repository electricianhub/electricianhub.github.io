More than 2,000 children are in emergency rooms due to electrical burns or shocks each year. For example, let's say you have a circuit with wiring rated to handle 15 amps. Adding an additional fixture to a low voltage system is relatively easy, so long as there's enough power coming from the transformer to power the light. Instead, electricity flows from the transformer terminal into your house and electronics and back again by way of continuous wire paths between them.</p>

Power surges can happen to literally anybody and you want to be prepared when it happens to you. Choosing the right electrician for either a residential or commercial task is no small feat. You flip a switch — the lights turn on. You flip it again — off they go.

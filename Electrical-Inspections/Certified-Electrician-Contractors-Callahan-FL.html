Master Electrician: Completion of an approved 576-hour educational course along with proof of 4,000 hours of work experience as a journeyman electrician. The two 120 volt wires are obtained by grounding the centertap of the transformer supplying the house so that when one hot wire is swinging positive with respect to ground, the other is swinging negative.</p>

Go ahead and give us a call today and will be able to help you through any of the problems you are having with your electrical wiring systems. Be absolutely certain before testing your generator you have turned off the circuit breakers in the main panel to your AC.

<p>Connect the wires to the light fixtures. Electrical Contractor License: Class A or Class B license or Class C certificate is required depending on the type of projects you work on. There will be times when you need to open a light switch with wet hands, or maybe forget to dry your hands before you touch and turn on the switch. From time to time, fixtures require replacement, or new fixtures are needed to highlight interior design decisions.

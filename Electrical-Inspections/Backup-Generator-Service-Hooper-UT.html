Running a unit too close to its rated output reduces fuel efficiency and makes the engine run harder. When the automatic transfer switch senses that the generator is running and producing power it automatically disconnects the utility power line and reconnects to the generator power line, providing emergency power to your a home or building within seconds of a sudden power outage.</p>

The professionals at Dan Wood Company understand that and will always make sure your home's electrical needs are meticulously taken care of-as they should be. A breaker box or a fuse panel in need of repair or replacement is no exception to this. In the case of FPE, they lost their UL listing when it was discovered their breakers would not necessarily trip when they needed to. A circuit breaker is always sized to the load that it serves and the wire size it is supposed to protect.</p>

After that time you expose yourself to potential electrical dangers by overloading your system with the latest electrical equipment.</p>

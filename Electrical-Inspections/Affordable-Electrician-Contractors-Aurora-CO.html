This makes them much more common for large-scale outdoor projects, including landscape lighting projects. Indoor reduced voltage lighting is also very affordable and convenient to use. If you can't get the transformer close enough to your light fixtures you will need to up the voltage that your line carries. Worn cords and damaged plugs increase your risk of both fires and electrical shocks.</p>

It is required to stop a homeowner (or someone else) from using the ground wire as a neutral, leaving the circuit without a ground. While changing a light bulb can be simple, installing new fixtures and wiring are jobs for a professional electrician.</p>
<p>Look in the fuse box or breaker box and see what rating the fuse is set at, look on the outer sheathing on the wire and see what its rating is.

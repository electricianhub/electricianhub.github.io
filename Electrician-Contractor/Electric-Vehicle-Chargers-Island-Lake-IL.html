For this reason, it is prudent to invest in a Surge Protective Device or SPD to eliminate these potential threats and thus maximize the systems life expectancy. Most of us take electricity for granted, fully expecting that the outlets, wiring, extension cords, and power strips in our homes will operate safely and reliably. Power strips let us attach several devices to the same socket, drawing more current through that socket than it is ordinarily expected to conduct.</p>

<p>Child safety wall plates should be installed to cover socket holes when electrical outlets are not in use. If you see sparks, smell something burning (especially if it smells like rubber) or find evidence of electrical shorting like blackened spots and melted insulators, shut off the device, disconnect the electricity that serves that portion of your home and call an electrician. Surge protectors and power strips can be used safely if they are not overloaded.</p>

<p>Furthermore, electrical panel replacement or upgrade also prevents recurring power surges. And, you should also use electrical equipment, devices, and wiring that exceed minimum standards.

<p>Put safety plugs over all electrical outlets to prevent children from sticking screwdrivers, nails, pins, or other metal objects into them. These surges can often be small and inconsequential, but there is a risk of your expensive electronics and home appliances to be damaged or completely taken out by a power surge. Another helpful thing you can do is install surge protectors. Even if you were to upgrade your electrical panel on your own, that in and of itself won't increase the power supply to your home.</p>

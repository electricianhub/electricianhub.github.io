<p>If necessary, loosen the screws a half-turn and align the switch-outlet vertically by hand, then tighten the screws. If any outlet emits a burning odor or sparks, shut down the electrical panel right away and call an electrician for help , as you could be at immediate risk for fire. If the surge protector worked TOO effectively, and siphoned away too much of the electric current then the appliance would not be able to work.

<h2>How To Hire Certified Electrician in Chatsworth</h2>

In addition to doing your own DIY electrical safety check, make sure to schedule an electrical safety inspection with a professional Your licensed electrician should inspect your home every year to make sure the electrical system meets the safety provisions provided in the National Electrical Code ( NEC ).

The Line terminals (green arrows in photo at left) on an electrical receptacle are for the incoming hot wire - the terminal marked LINE is connected to the incoming power source or the "hot" wire (typically black or red in insulation color) that connects to the brass colored screw (marked "Black" or "Noir) at the lower left " in our photo.</p>

<p>Electrical shocks can knock you unconscious, cause deep tissue burns, and stop your breathing and heartbeat. Class 2 In-Wall Rated Wire provides an extra layer of installation that is more resistant to cracking or melting, and is approved by the NEC to be installed inside walls. Master Electrician: You must be at least 22 years old and have 12,000 hours of experience, with at least 6 years' experience under the leadership of a master electrician, and pass an exam.</p>

So, sizing generators isn't as simple as saying, If your home has this many sq. ft., then you must get this size generator.‚Äù It's slightly more complex than that, and an experienced electrician will calculate your home's anticipated electrical loads and recommend the right size generator.</p>
<p>Make sure the breaker to the switch is on in your breaker box and determine whether there are any other tripped outlets and switch them on as well. Home electrical fires or electrocutions injure or kill thousands of people in the U.S. every year. The average cost to replace a fuse box with a breaker panel is $1,100 to $4,000 and depends on what capacity the new breaker panel can handle.

Old fuse boxes were never designed to handle the electrical load we now require from our homes.

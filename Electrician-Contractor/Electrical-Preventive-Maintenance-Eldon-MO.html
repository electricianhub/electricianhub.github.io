Low voltage landscape lighting wire or landscape lighting cable as it is often referred as, is made of multi-strands of copper wire that are bound together. According to the EFSi, arcing faults cause more than 30,000 home fires each year in the US alone, resulting in hundreds of deaths and injuries - atop more than $750 million in property damage.</p>

You will have to replace the wire from the switch to the disposal with a 3 conductor wire, using it to wire a half hot outlet in the wall to plug both dishwasher and disposal into.</p>

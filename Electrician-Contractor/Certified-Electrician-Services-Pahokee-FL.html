<p>Permanent home standby generators are your ideal partner in providing solutions to that much needed backup power during electricity outages. Here's MY conundrumâ€¦ I want to build myself a custom POWER BAR or two, to add outlets into my bench and desk areas. Turn off the mains electricity, and then remove all of the circuits from the panel. But generators come in a range of types, sizes and costs, so you'll want to put a fair amount of thought into this high-involvement purchase.

Electrical safety involving outlets, plugs and extension cords is one of the most important home safety issues. We work with all types of wiring and equipment and can have your electrical issues fixed in no time.</p>

<p>Your generator will stay more reliable if you are frequently inspecting and performing planned maintenance services at the recommended intervals. The upgrade will include disconnecting and then reconnecting the power line to the home, installing a new meter socket outside and replacing the circuit breaker panel.

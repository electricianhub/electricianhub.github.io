We'll show you the difference between a residential and commercial electrician, where to find a qualified electrician, what types of questions to ask your contractor, and more.</p>

The front of the house isn't the only place to use landscape lights. Outlets will need to meet or exceed your local electrical codes to ensure the safety of your home and family. Due to these requirements, 120v systems are relatively permanent once they are installed. This can save you money by turning off the pathway lighting or special art enhancing spotlights after certain hours of the night.</p>

<p>Craig came as scheduled and had it done in 2 days which is what they told us it would be. He was neat and clean and did the job in a professional manner. When you entrust your generator to All Services, you're assured of high-quality service and highly dependable results. The designer also used the old-growth trees as lighting focal points - making sure to illuminate the tree canopies as much as possible. In this case, you must change the cable from the switch to the light outlet from a 2-wire to a 3-wire cable.</p>
<p>In order to keep your landscape lighting system performing and looking like the day it was installed, it is essential to have regular outdoor lighting maintenance performed.

<p>If you plan on buying individual lights or if you plan on buying a kit, here is one important question you need to ask yourself: "How will the transformer turn on and off?" Most likely you don't live in an area of the world where the sun rises and sets at the same time each day, so I recommend buying a transformer that has a photocell light sensor, the light sensor turns your outdoor lighting on at dusk and then it should have some sort of control so you can adjust how long the lights will stay on for.</p>
<p>Take extra care not to throw strings of lights over tree branches that are near power lines and service connections. Depending on just how your outlets were done, you will may have to nut two blacks together on the first outlet, along with a 6" "pigtail" that goes to the outlet.

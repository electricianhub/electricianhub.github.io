Others will have a photo cell that can determine whether it is dark enough out to cycle the lights on. Make sure to get a transformer that fits your needs. Generators running on diesel fuel can run for up to 30,000 hours before needing maintenance, while gas-powered generators may run only 10,000 hours before needing a checkup.</p>

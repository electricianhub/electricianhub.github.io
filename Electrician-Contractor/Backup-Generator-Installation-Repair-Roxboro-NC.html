<p>The typical surge protector that everyone is familiar with is a long brick with anywhere from 3 to 8 outlets on it. The quality of this brick is determined by how much effort the manufacturer puts into the design and materials. DO watch out for power lines when using a ladder, chainsaw or other outdoor equipment. Install indoor or outdoor lighting. Accent Fixtures: The unsung heroes of any landscape lighting design are the accent lights.

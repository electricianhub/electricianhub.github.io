If your project is large, for example, a new home lighting design project, then you should definitely hire a professional. Durable, long-lasting, and environmentally friendly, LED lights are exactly what the world needs now.

<p>Malfunctioning electric service can cause voltage drop on both Hot wires or either Hot wire. Turn the electricity back on and if it was the switch or outlet that was faulty, your light and outlet should work properly. Any business owner knows that time is money, so time lost waiting for electricity to come back on is money lost as well.

That leaves you with two wires - one old and the new 6" piece - to go to the switch.</p>

Circuit breakers are designed to trip when overloaded or when there is a short circuit or electrical problem. Use a portable ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) cord if your outdoor outlets don't have GFCIs.</p>

<p>I expect that the boards will develop schemes of assisted wiring which are usually outside the range of the electrical contractors' functions. All you need is a home generator that will supply you with the needed electricity based on the power that it has stored. Electrical equipment plays an important role in the safe transmission and distribution of electrical power.

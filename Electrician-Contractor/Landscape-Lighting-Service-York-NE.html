<p>The white and ground (bare) wires are to be secured under the bar(s) in the main panel. Outdated electrical components can overload your home's wiring, leading to a tripped breaker (loss of power) or a fire hazard.

<p>A surge protector attempts to limit the voltage supplied to an electric device by either blocking or shorting to ground any unwanted voltages above a safe threshold. In this article series we describe low-voltage wiring, controls, and power supplies operating usually at 24VAC and that in turn are used to control line-voltage devices operating usually at 120VAC or 240VAC. An electrician working on a commercial or industrial building must be able to correctly size loads.</p>

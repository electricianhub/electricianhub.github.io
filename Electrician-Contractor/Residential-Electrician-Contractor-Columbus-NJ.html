<p>If the light switch was improperly wired, it will get hot. According to the Centers for Disease Control, the most common injuries caused by contact with electrical energy are electric shock, burns, and falls. Because multiple conductors bundled in a cable cannot dissipate heat as easily as single insulated conductors, those circuits are always rated at a lower " ampacity ". Tables in electrical safety codes give the maximum allowable current based on size of conductor, voltage potential, insulation type and thickness, and the temperature rating of the cable itself.</p>

We offer purpose-suited emergency electrical generators suitable for almost any size house or business and almost any budget, from small home units to 100,000 kilowatt workhorses.

This whole-home generator is able to generate up to 20,000 watts of power using propane (LPG) or 18,000 watts using natural gas.

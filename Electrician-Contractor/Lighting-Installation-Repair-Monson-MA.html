When working properly the electricity is fed through the positive wire into a load, such as an appliance, then it returns to the electrical panel via the neutral wire. Wiring electrical outlets (properly called receptacles) and switches involve many of the same basic techniques. A power surge is something that can happen for a number of reasons, the main one being a lightning strike.</p>

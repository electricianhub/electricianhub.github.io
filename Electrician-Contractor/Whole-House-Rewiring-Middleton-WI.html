Add extension stems to raise the height of the fixtures in groundcover areas or adjust locations as the landscape material matures. Increasingly, electricians will be needed to link these alternative power sources to homes and power grids over the coming decade.</p>
<p>Most single-pole switches will have two black wires connected to the switch — one will serve as the "hot" wire, bringing power to the switch, and the other is the "load" wire, sending power out to the light.

Circuit Breaker: These GFCI outlets protect and entire circuit board rather than a single outlet. Electrical licenses are not awarded at the state level in New York.

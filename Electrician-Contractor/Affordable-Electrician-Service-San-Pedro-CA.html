<p>A battery backup surge protector is the perfect solution for the persistent threat of power outages and data loss. It can be intimidating to even examine your existing circuit breaker or fuse box. As water conducts electricity, keeping outlets away from water reduces the chance of electric shock. Lock out or tag all electrical equipment or lines while they are being serviced, maintained or adjusted. They can also work in a factory, overseeing the production and the manufacturing of consumer electronics and other electrical equipment. However, if you are sure you need even more power then there are portable generators with 12,000 or even 15,000 (15 kw) running watts.</p>

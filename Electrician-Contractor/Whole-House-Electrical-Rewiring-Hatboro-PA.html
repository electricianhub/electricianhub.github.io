When you're done drilling holes, pull the cable between the boxes and to the service panel to complete the circuit. To figure out exactly where the wires are, you'll look f­or the outlets and appliances that each wire connects to. You'll also figure out which circuit breaker applies to which section of your home's wiring. These devices improve electrical safety by tripping and disconnecting power transmission when the line connecting the electric panel and your appliances becomes overloaded and at risk of heating up and burning.</p>

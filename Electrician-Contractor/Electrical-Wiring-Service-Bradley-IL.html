Overload protection is achieved in almost all controllers by placing heating elements in series with the motor leads on polyphase motors. If you don't have enough circuits to serve all of your electrical equipment, consult an electrician or power supplier; you will probably need a larger service entrance.</p>
<p>This is why the insurance companies would like the panel changed over from fuses to breakers. This is particurly important if any extension cords are being used in a basement where flooding is possible and water damage could compromise the cord and lead to other dangers.

Most states require electricians to pass a test and be licensed. In all events, regardless of which connection point you are using, receptacles and switches have a designated side or screw or connector set for the white (neutral wire) (typically the side that has a silver colored screw and that is marked NEUTRAL on the device) and for the black (hot wire) (typically the side that has a brass-colored screwed and is marked LINE or HOT or BLACKI).</p>

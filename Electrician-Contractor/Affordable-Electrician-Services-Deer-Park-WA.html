<p>When your business depends on electrical machinery and equipment for increased productivity and improved cash flow, it is extremely important to keep that machinery inspected and well-maintained on a regular basis. Lightning protection standards ensure how to properly place air terminals, run cable, ground and bond in order to ensure maximum safety in this energy transfer and dissipation.

<p>The increase in amps over the years has kept pace with the number of new electrical appliances. The truth is that nearly every home needs a backup generator in case of a power outage. Feed your new wire, as much as you need to reach your new outlet hole, through the electrical box hole you just made. If there is no tripped breaker or blown fuse, I suspect a damaged receptacle, wire, or wire connector. Although a portable generator has the capacity to generate power for many appliances, a backup battery system can also be sized to service more than one appliance.</p>

<p>When there's only one cable entering an outlet box, it means the outlet is the last fixture on the circuit. You can also substitute up to 1 year of work experience for completion of a 2-year, post-high school course in electrical technology and passing an exam. If you have an older circuit breaker panel in your home, then you may find that it does not have enough amps to manage all of the items in your home.

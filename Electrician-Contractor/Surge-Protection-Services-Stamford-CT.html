<p>Upgrading your main service panel is the best way to guarantee that your system won't leave you in the dark when you need it most. In many homes, if a room does not have an overhead light, most builders will install a switch that controls half of the outlets in the room. The majority of these electrical appliances require a 240V circuit. Use a circuit tester on the black and white wires to make sure there is no current. As an unlicensed individual, legally you can't charge for electrician work because you won't be able to pull a permit or schedule an inspection.</p>

The controller is faulty if there are no voltmeter readings on all three of the terminal pairs. The generator is paired with a transfer switch containing a predetermined number of circuits based on the generator's kW power rating. Damaged power cords are a serious residential electrical safety risk, and they are capable of causing both fires and electrocution.</p>

You purchased a standby generator because you needed power no matter what the conditions are.</p>
<p>Put safety plugs over all electrical outlets to prevent children from sticking screwdrivers, nails, pins, or other metal objects into them. These surges can often be small and inconsequential, but there is a risk of your expensive electronics and home appliances to be damaged or completely taken out by a power surge. Another helpful thing you can do is install surge protectors. Even if you were to upgrade your electrical panel on your own, that in and of itself won't increase the power supply to your home.</p>

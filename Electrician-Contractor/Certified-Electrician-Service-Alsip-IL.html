Professional outdoor landscape lighting adds beauty, character and safety to your home - not to mention being the finish work of your landscaping. Landscape Lighting can have a big impact on your home and how people perceive it. Whether your going for the ideal curb appeal or simply home security, here are a few Landscape Lighting Tips to help you along the way.</p>

According to the Centers for Disease Control, the most common injuries caused by contact with electrical energy are electric shock, burns, and falls. Because multiple conductors bundled in a cable cannot dissipate heat as easily as single insulated conductors, those circuits are always rated at a lower " ampacity ". Tables in electrical safety codes give the maximum allowable current based on size of conductor, voltage potential, insulation type and thickness, and the temperature rating of the cable itself.</p>
<p>Always get the advice of a qualified electrician to see if your panel can be saved before deciding to get an electric panel replacement.

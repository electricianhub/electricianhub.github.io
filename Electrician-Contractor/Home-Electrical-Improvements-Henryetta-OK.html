The result of a properly installed system is a beautifully illuminated landscape and a safe installation. Photocells can be used to automatically switch lights on and off at dusk and dawn, and some light fittings come with these built in. Similarly PIR detectors switch lights on when someone approaches, and these are often built in to security lights.</p>

A red "protected" LED indicator illuminates when the surge-protector power strip is turned on, showing that it's protecting plugged-in devices.</p>
<p>A licensed electrician can check your electrical panel, tighten any wires that need it, and even use an infrared tester to identify which circuit breakers are getting too hot in the fuse box. To be up to code and ensure you're not potentially endangering power workers, you should run the generator into a power transfer switch.

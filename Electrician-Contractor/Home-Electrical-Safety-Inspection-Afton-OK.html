Home standby generators are installed permanently, can run on natural gas or propane, and kick on automatically during an outage.

<p>This panel, in conjunction with the breaker box inside, is accountable for monitoring and regulating the electrical current that flows through your residential home. Whether you are looking for an manual transfer switch to connect your existing generator to your electrical system or an automatic transfer switch that turns on automatically when the power goes off VPC has you covered.

<p>There is one aspect of electrical panel replacement that few people ever consider, and that's the immense savings you can receive. Old electric panels contain fuses, which can have problems.

First and foremost of these reasons is their ability to use less power than other commercial lighting fixtures, making them very cost effective from an energy conservation perspective.</p>

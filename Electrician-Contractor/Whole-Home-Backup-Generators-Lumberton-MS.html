When a circuit is overloaded with electricity, maybe your lights are flickering, a fuse will blow and needs to be replaced.</p>

Typically a quality home surge protector will have three or more MOVs lined up in a row to expand the capabilities of the unit. Working conditions for electricians vary by specialization.

<p>Breaker panels and fuse box panels are complex and delicate, and it's never a good idea to try and DIY your breaker panel upgrade or replacement. Nowadays people are turning to energy efficient lighting technologies to accomplish this by using lower voltage landscape lighting. The bulb's intense heat can scorch or melt the socket and insulation on the fixture's wires, which increases the risk of arcing — sparks that jump through the air from one wire to another — a chief cause of electrical fires.</p>
<p>Just like wall outlets, light switches have a limit on how much power they can handle, and different switches are rated for different levels of power. We offer purpose-suited emergency electrical generators suitable for almost any size house or business and almost any budget, from small home units to 100,000 kilowatt workhorses.

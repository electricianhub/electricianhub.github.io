It is possible, and you can turn the power off and pull the outlet out of the box to see what is there, but if there are no other wires but those terminated on the outlet you would have to run another wire from the switch to the outlet.

<p>If you want a whole house generator that can power 90-100% of your home on natural gas or propane, call a pro from the start. Plugging too many items into outlets is the cause of many house fires. Older homes may have small electrical panels with minimal loads that may not be able to service high-power, modern appliances. When electrical contractors have a good understanding of what a job involves, they can then make plans on how to proceed.

Instead, splice the neutrals from the feed to the GFCI and the under-sink outlet together, splice a short jumper to the black feed to the GFCI, and connect that jumper to a new switch. If necessary, remove all the wires but one, check the outlet for power, and then use a different wire.</p>
<p>The most common method of protecting equipment is through a point-of-use protector, also known as a surge protector strip or outlet. Here at Swick Home Services, we implement customized solutions and provide you with effective electrical repair and replacement services.

Proper identification of the type of electrical wire and wire insulation is useful for those seeking to guess at the age of a building or of its electrical system, and in some instances it is helpful in assessing the condition and safety of the building wiring system, such as taking note of the presence of branch circuit solid conductor aluminum electrical wire that has not been properly repaired - a fire hazard.</p>

<p>Thank you so much for helping, I found where the main power comes from and it's hooked to the GFI that's next to the switch, so I did a pigtail of the (hot) black wire to the switch and then the other black wire that runs from the outlet from underneath the sink to the other bronze screw on the switch.

<p>An electrical contractor's licence is a business licence only. The ground-fault circuit interrupters are a must for affirming the electrical safety in wet locations.

<p>Are you remodeling your home and need to install new lighting? Price: Prior to installation, it's important to know what your budget is and how much you can afford to invest in these systems. Tools and equipment - Electricians already have the best tools and everything they need to do the job. Check that any bid you receive on a job specifies the services of a licensed electrician, who is also fully insured and bonded. A portable has to be rolled outside, started manually, and plugged in to the house electrical system, a process that takes several minutes at least—if someone is at home to do it. And if an outage lasts more than a few hours, a portable's gas tank is likely to run dry.</p>

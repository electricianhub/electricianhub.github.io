<p>For example, a 300-watt transformer can power 100 feet of 16-gauge cable, or 150 feet of 14-gauge cable, or 200 feet of 12-gauge cable. Power surges can happen to literally anybody and you want to be prepared when it happens to you. Choosing the right electrician for either a residential or commercial task is no small feat. You flip a switch — the lights turn on. You flip it again — off they go. The internal workings that create that light can come from a complex system of light switch wiring — especially in older construction that may not be up to modern code.</p>

<p>If your home does not have landscape lighting, there are two very good reasons why you should consider installing some. With the help of a battery backup APC AV Surge Protector will serve the purpose. The best option for upgrading your home's service panel is to hire a local electrician. I'm going to assume that the top half is unswitched, and that it has black wires going to it. This will make sure that if the top receptacle was the switched receptacle, then it will remain the same on the new outlet. At excel Electricians LTD we want to offer our clients a perfect service.

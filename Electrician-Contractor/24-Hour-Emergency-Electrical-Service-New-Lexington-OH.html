More than 2,000 children are in emergency rooms due to electrical burns or shocks each year. For example, let's say you have a circuit with wiring rated to handle 15 amps. Adding an additional fixture to a low voltage system is relatively easy, so long as there's enough power coming from the transformer to power the light. Instead, electricity flows from the transformer terminal into your house and electronics and back again by way of continuous wire paths between them.</p>
<p>Typically, you will experience brownouts or lights dimming when other items are turned on. Other signs would be fuses frequently blowing and or breakers tripping.

For example, by installing low voltage outdoor lighting, you can add a feature to your home that will be visually pleasing and help you keep money in your pockets.</p>

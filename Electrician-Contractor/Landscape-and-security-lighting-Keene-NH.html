<p>2. If you need to remove the wires from the lighting fixture and reconnect it to the connector, then please insert the wires into the bottom of the jack through its center, making sure that the metal needles in the jack penetrate the wire insulation to reach the conductor. The most commos safety issue we see is when multiple circuits are installed under one fuse. During this time aluminum was a lot cheaper than copper and it conducted pretty similarly. You'll then connect the bare copper ground wire to the green screw.</p>
<p>Uplighting: Uplighting is most commonly used to light up a tree from the ground and highlight its structure and shape. You can use this type of landscape lighting to highlight large and exotic trees in your compounds. Half the circuits in this fusebox are fitted with automatic RCD (residual-current device) protection, which greatly reduce the risk of electric shocks when you accidentally cut through power cables.

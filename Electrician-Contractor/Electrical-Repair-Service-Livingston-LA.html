<p>Look in the fuse box or breaker box and see what rating the fuse is set at, look on the outer sheathing on the wire and see what its rating is. If you are continually resetting breakers or replacing fuses then there is likely to be a fault and more current is trying to be drawn than the circuit is designed for.

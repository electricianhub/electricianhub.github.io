Because of this, if you decide to go with low voltage lighting, it's important to communicate with your electrician and your cabinet installer. Also, faulty outlets and wiring could also pose a fire risk in your home, which is why immediate diagnosis and repair is needed. You want your lights to be very discreet so you are more focused on what's lit up than the light fixture itself.</p>

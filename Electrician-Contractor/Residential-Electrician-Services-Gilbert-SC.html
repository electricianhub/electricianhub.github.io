<p>Why Your Home Could Need an Electrical Panel Upgrade. Having identified a location for your new outlet, trace the electrical box onto the wall. With an automatic backup generator properly installed outside, your home is protected from deadly carbon monoxide poisoning that is a much greater risk with portable generators.

<p>Labeling - If you are keen enough, you will find that electrical wires have letters on them.

<p>Pretty much all of the previously switched outlets were improperly changed over. If the line fuses check good, then check the voltage between terminals T1 T2, T2 T3, and T1 T3. The controller is faulty if there are no voltmeter readings on all three of the terminal pairs.

Another helpful thing you can do is install surge protectors. Even if you were to upgrade your electrical panel on your own, that in and of itself won't increase the power supply to your home.</p>

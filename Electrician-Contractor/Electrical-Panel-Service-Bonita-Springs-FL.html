<p>If you live in an older home, you may have outlets that don't have a third or grounded” hole. This is especially important if you have small children in the house; you'll want to keep all of the electrical outlets covered.

Some electrical contractors specialize in maintenance and repair. At the same time electronics devices need the maximum protection that is available.</p>

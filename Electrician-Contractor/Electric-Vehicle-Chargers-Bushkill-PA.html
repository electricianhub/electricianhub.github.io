<p>It quickly entered the consumer sector by manufacturing electric fans and by 1960, emerged as one of the biggest suppliers of electrical equipment. A circuit breaker is an automatically operated electrical switch designed to protect an electrical circuit from damage caused by excess current from an overload or short circuit.

When you're done drilling holes, pull the cable between the boxes and to the service panel to complete the circuit.

If the power demand for a circuit approaches the amps the circuit is rated for, the circuit breaker will trip and shut down power to the circuit, because there is a danger of the wiring overheating.</p>

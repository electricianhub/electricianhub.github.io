<p>If your home does not have landscape lighting, there are two very good reasons why you should consider installing some.

Section 411.4 states that low-voltage lighting systems must not be concealed or the wiring must not extend through a building wall, unless using a wiring method specified in chapter 3. The power supply cannot be installed in a concealed location behind drywall or where access is rendered inaccessible without damaging or destroying the building finish.</p>
<p>A licensed electrician has fulfilled the criteria to obtain professional insurance to work in their field, and licensing can also indicate that a contractor has paid a bond covering their work. The wiring arrangement of the inset lights goes beneath the deck and is connected to the transformer. When you need professional electricians, we know there are plenty to choose from. When the voltage tester lights up or makes a noise next to a wire (it will be one of the black wires), mark that wire in some way (I usually make a quick mark on the wire nut with a permanent marker).</p>

Although many electricians are trained in 4-5 year apprenticeship programs, formal certificate and associate's degree programs are also available for aspiring residential electricians. Either way, you will need what is called "3-wire cable" (black, red, white, and green OR metal all sheathed together: yes I know that makes 4 wires, but that's what it's called!) to connect the two boxes.</p>
<p>Over time, however, panels can age, and their components wear out, which will necessitate repairs. You will also need a firm understanding of Ohms law (Volt x Amps = Watts) and how it works in relation to laying out the wiring for the lighting system.

It seems like it would be easier to convert the outlet to always-on, cap the wires, and install a wireless remote wall mount that could control the smart light switch I might add in place of the current dimmer.</p>

Generally, we are well and safe as long as the proper electrical safety mechanisms such as fuses, circuit breakers, etc are in place and we stay vigilant (not foolhardy) when working around electricity and electrical applicances.</p>

<p>Single core or double core or three core TRS cables with a circular oval shape cables are used in this kind of wiring.

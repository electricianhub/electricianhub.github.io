<p>Although most electricians learn through an apprenticeship, some start out by attending a technical school. They range from expensive architectural grade deck light fixtures with metal housings and baked on finish for long years of use to systems with plastic housings at a lower cost and shorter life span.

Simply plug a Switcheroo into your switched outlet, and then another Switcheroo into as many outlets that you want to turn on and off with your existing switch.

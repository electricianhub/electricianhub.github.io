<h2>How To Hire Licensed Electrician in Wynantskill</h2>
<p>Electricity problems at home can be quite unnerving and it can be frustrating when it occurs at midnight especially in summers. The electrical wiring in a home service panel can be confusing when taking the DIY approach, and an improperly installed device could result in defects or danger to those installing it. The home surge protector may not function properly if not installed correctly and at worse, could cause more damage. When there is a surge, the extra voltage is diverted to the grounding wire inside the surge protector. Speak to our friendly staff, who are on hand to assist you day or night with your emergency electrical fault and we'll have a technician out there in a flash.</p>

<p>If your two plug ins (two electrical receptacles) are located in the same electrical box (we call this a "quad" electrical receptacle installation since each individual receptacle provides connections for two wall plugs), you'll want to wire the hot and neutral to one pair of screws on the first receptacle, and use short black and white jumper wires to connect the the proper terminals on the first receptacle to the second one in the same box. If the outlets ARE half hot, with one half of it switched, it will not be possible to reproduce that with the new outlets.</p>

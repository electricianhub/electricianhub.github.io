Due to the fact that it involves working so closely with electrical wires, any work involving your circuit breaker panel requires the assistance of qualified and experienced electricians. Not manufactured since the mid-1970s, these panels have design flaws that allow power to flow even when the breakers appear off.</p>
<p>If you want a whole house generator that can power 90-100% of your home on natural gas or propane, call a pro from the start. Plugging too many items into outlets is the cause of many house fires.

The safety of your home and family is of great magnitude; call in an Albrite professional to handle your panel upgrade needs. Even a portable generator can run at a constant 80 decibels - about the sound of a loud lawnmower, and running continuously A whole house unit is generally more efficient and more insulated.</p>
<p>Electricians will use their extensive experience in domestic lighting to provide a solution that is right for your home. This is the maximum capacity of your entire home's electrical system, in amps. Attach the first wire you unscrew to the same-colored screw on the new switch as it was on the old; do the same with the second.

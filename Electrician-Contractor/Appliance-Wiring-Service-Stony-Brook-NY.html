Start by taking off the switch plate by removing the two screws that secure it to the light switch.</p>
<p>Choose between natural gas generators and propane generators based on what's available in your area. Portable generators can handle brief power outages; they are capable of powering your essential appliances during an outage.

Constant voltage will power LED arrays with a steady voltage regardless of current.</p>

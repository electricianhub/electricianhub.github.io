<p>Additionally, some folks try to hide extension cords under rugs, carpets, furniture, and other items. 10 to 15 feet total cable length is pretty much the limit with a single tap 12 volt transformer however with a transformer running at 22 volts you can often have several 100 feet of cable. In addition to the importance of proper installation, undergoing regular generator maintenance is incredibly important for homeowners and businesses who want their generator to last as long as possible and operate as efficiently as possible.</p>

<p>What is the best electrical house wiring guide? Over time, the parts inside the protector wear down, reducing its effectiveness. The first fixture should be at least 10 feet from your transformer to prevent it from getting too much voltage and burning out prematurely. Due to this, our team of skilled electricians will pay attention to every detail of the installation process.

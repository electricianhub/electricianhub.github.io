<p>Outdoor lighting has many benefits but most importantly it provides homeowners with extra safety and security during night time hours. Breakers Are Tripping - When you have a breaker that's tripping, there's too much power that's flowing through your circuit. In this course, you will learn about the fundamentals of series and parallel circuits as well as how to calculate current, voltage, and resistance in them. The goal of learning about electrical safety is to not become an expert in electricity or electrical repair but to gain enough knowledge to be able to react in an emergency. Set a voltage tester to "Volts" and touch the tip of each tester-wire to a terminal screw at opposite sides of the switch-outlet.</p>

It is not hard to find excellent and safe lighting choices with low voltage technology created especially to live up your property. The cables for low voltage lighting are usually 10 or 12 gauge wire.</p>

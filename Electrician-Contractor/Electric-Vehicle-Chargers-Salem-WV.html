The front of the house isn't the only place to use landscape lights. Outlets will need to meet or exceed your local electrical codes to ensure the safety of your home and family. Due to these requirements, 120v systems are relatively permanent once they are installed. This can save you money by turning off the pathway lighting or special art enhancing spotlights after certain hours of the night.</p>

Connect the power cable to the transformer, and mount the transformer. Smarten up your existing landscape lighting to control lights and adjust settings with the Ring App. Outdoor lighting not only extends the beauty of your landscape into the evening hours, it transforms the winter landscape from something mundane into a valued time of enjoyment.</p>

<p>We get it, there can be a ton of confusion when it comes to different types of electricians. If the lights and receptacles are wired with a multi-wire circuit than it doesn't matter as both circuits, if wired correctly on the two pole circuit breakers, will shut off anyway. You must still remove the red (or whatever color is switched) wires and splice them together with a wire nut if there is more than one of them. Immediately addressing the problem with your electrical panel will help you avoid emergency situations and potential issues such as power surges, electrical shocks, and circuit overloads.</p>

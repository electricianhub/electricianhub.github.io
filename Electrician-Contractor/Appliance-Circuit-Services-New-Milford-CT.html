Homes are wired in this manner, if you have ever replaced a light fixture, you would have noticed the wires are twisted together then capped with a wire nut, I also use this method when repairing automotive wiring, it makes a great connection, and it's permanent. Electricians inspect and test existing wiring and electrical equipment to determine if repairs or replacements are needed.</p>

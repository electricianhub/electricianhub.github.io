<p>What is the best electrical house wiring guide? Over time, the parts inside the protector wear down, reducing its effectiveness. The first fixture should be at least 10 feet from your transformer to prevent it from getting too much voltage and burning out prematurely. Due to this, our team of skilled electricians will pay attention to every detail of the installation process. Our experienced team can bring your landscape to life at night by lighting patios, arbors, steps, decks, walkways, trees, driveways and planting beds.</p>

<p>The end of the wire may be simply attached with red or black electrical tape.

These lights mostly use 12-volts of electricity, along with one power transformer will be attached to your standard 110-volts outlet that is prevalent on most properties in the USA.</p>

<p>Another option is to wire the lights in a loop, with the wire returning to the transformer. If it was you have two circuits in each box and outlet, and very likely have 240 volts in the outlet boxes, which is OK but any such box (and outlet) needs labeled indicating that. This should also include any trees, garden decor, or special features of the landscaping Taking measurements will also help when it comes time to purchase the lighting fixtures, particularly if you are going to use low voltage lighting, because you need to have the right amount of cabling for the entire project.</p>

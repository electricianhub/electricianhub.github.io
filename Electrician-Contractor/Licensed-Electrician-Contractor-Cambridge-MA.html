For example, select a transformer rated for 400 or 500 watts if you have landscape lights equaling 300 watts, such as six 50-watt pathway lights. Surge protection has been required by the National Electrical Code (NEC) since 2014, and 82% of surveyed professionals indicated that surge protection is necessary to protect expensive equipment.</p>
<p>Furthermore, electrical panel replacement or upgrade also prevents recurring power surges. And, you should also use electrical equipment, devices, and wiring that exceed minimum standards. Those permanent home standby generators are mostly built with an auto transfer switch that recognizes an interruption in the power supply so that it switches on to supply and provide power for the home's appliances such as the refrigerators, air conditioning systems, and many more.</p>
<p>Moreover, frequent power surges of a lower intensity, while usually undetected and seldom strong enough to cause immediate damage, can, over time, degrade the performance and decrease the lifespan of your computer. Remember that with simple power management” techniques, a small generator can provide adequate power for home or recreational applications. Improperly used extension cords, faulty or damaged wiring, and poorly insulated wires can lead to electrical fires.</p>

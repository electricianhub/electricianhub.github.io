<p>Pretty much all of the previously switched outlets were improperly changed over. If the line fuses check good, then check the voltage between terminals T1 T2, T2 T3, and T1 T3. The controller is faulty if there are no voltmeter readings on all three of the terminal pairs. The generator is paired with a transfer switch containing a predetermined number of circuits based on the generator's kW power rating. Damaged power cords are a serious residential electrical safety risk, and they are capable of causing both fires and electrocution.</p>

<p>This course provides skills related to the wiring of single-family buildings. Is available to our customers twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. Start by separating the black and white wires from the bare copper by grabbing each with pliers and twisting. Electric panels deliver energy through wires to be accessed through electrical outlets.

Rewiring or upgrading other electrical components should result in outlet switch upgrades.</p>

<p>You should also consider the wattage of the fixtures to stay within the capacity of the transformer. When planning lighting to go around seating areas keep the deck light fixtures relatively low. Decorative fixtures will be placed in plain sight; otherwise, conceal the light source when possible.

<p>If you already have access to gas lines, consider one of the many propane generators or natural gas generators.

Before starting the splicing project, make sure that you have everything you need including the low voltage lighting system, heat-shrink tubing, wire cutters or strippers, rosin-core solder, two-lead electrical wire, soldering iron and a blow-drier.</p>

<p>This course provides skills related to the wiring of single-family buildings. Is available to our customers twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week.

<p>You should also consider the wattage of the fixtures to stay within the capacity of the transformer. When planning lighting to go around seating areas keep the deck light fixtures relatively low.

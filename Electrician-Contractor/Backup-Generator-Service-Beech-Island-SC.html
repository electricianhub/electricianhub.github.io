<p>The wires connected to the switch are white (with black tape), black, and green.

Loop - This is a series run but instead of ending the wire at the last fixture, you arrange it so the wiring comes full circle, making a big loop” back to the transformer. Even if their home or exterior outlets do not have a GFCI, they can have the protection of a GFCI by using an extension cord.</p>
<p>If your two plug ins (two electrical receptacles) are located in the same electrical box (we call this a "quad" electrical receptacle installation since each individual receptacle provides connections for two wall plugs), you'll want to wire the hot and neutral to one pair of screws on the first receptacle, and use short black and white jumper wires to connect the the proper terminals on the first receptacle to the second one in the same box. If the outlets ARE half hot, with one half of it switched, it will not be possible to reproduce that with the new outlets.</p>

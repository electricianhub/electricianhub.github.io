<p>Power outages can happen unexpectedly for a variety of different reasons. You can't even get fuses for many fuse boxes anymore. But if the GFCI is recording a fault, then troubleshooting is required to find the loose wire, bad connection, defective electrical device, melted motor winding etc. In general, electricians say you can handle installing receptacles, outlets and lighting fixtures as a DIY job if you have a clear idea what you're doing, but more complex work requires expert help. The only difference is that the wires are insulated and covered by a flexible spiral made from aluminum or steel.</p>

Troubleshooting variable speed drive (VSD) systems effectively almost always requires in-depth knowledge of the controller, but it also requires broad knowledge of the systems that the drives are often a part of. When things go wrong, the problem is usually not in the controller, but somewhere in the system: in the motor, in the drive's links to the system, or in the electrical supply for the drive or the system.</p>

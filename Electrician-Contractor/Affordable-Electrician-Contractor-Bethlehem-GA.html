<p>Employers of Residential Electricians Across the U.S. Fuses are made from pieces of metal that melt when overheated so that they no longer work while circuit breakers have internal switch mechanisms that trip when there is an unsafe surge of electricity.

Generators running on diesel fuel can run for up to 30,000 hours before needing maintenance, while gas-powered generators may run only 10,000 hours before needing a checkup.</p>
<p>Consult an electrician to learn whether your home's panel is still capable of providing the electricity you need or whether it's time to consider an upgrade.

This compact generator is fitted with a commercial-grade single-cylinder Vanguard engine that produces 8,000 watts of power on liquid propane and 6,000 watts on natural gas.</p>
<p>With generators, the type of fuel used also matters as it will determine everything from how much it will cost to operate to its environment-friendliness. And even if your electrical panel doesn't seem like an immediate threat right now, it is still recommended that it be checked and potentially replaced before future problems occur.

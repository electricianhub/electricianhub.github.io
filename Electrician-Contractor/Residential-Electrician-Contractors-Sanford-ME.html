As a Residential Electrician, you'll have working knowledge of the National Electrical Code and know how to use the power and hand tools needed on the job. The national average to replace or upgrade an electric panel is right at $1,100, and upgrades regularly cost $500 - $1,500. Keep a Safe Distance from Fixtures: Any personal belongings and objects need to be kept at a safe distance from electrical fixtures like outlets and running appliances.</p>
<p>To access the wiring, gently pull the switches out of the electrical boxes. People often think of power strips when they hear "surge protection". Check electric cords often for damage.

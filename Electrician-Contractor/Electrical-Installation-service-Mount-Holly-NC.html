<p>If you plan on buying individual lights or if you plan on buying a kit, here is one important question you need to ask yourself: "How will the transformer turn on and off?" Most likely you don't live in an area of the world where the sun rises and sets at the same time each day, so I recommend buying a transformer that has a photocell light sensor, the light sensor turns your outdoor lighting on at dusk and then it should have some sort of control so you can adjust how long the lights will stay on for.</p>

This approach is general in nature allowing it to be used on any type of electrical circuit.</p>
<p>Additionally, portable generators can only be used safely outdoors or in a well-ventilated area away from a house or garage as they give off very toxic, deadly and odorless carbon monoxide. Old fuse boxes were never designed to handle the electrical load we now require from our homes.

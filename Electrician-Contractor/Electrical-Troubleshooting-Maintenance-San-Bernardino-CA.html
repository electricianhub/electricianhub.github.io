Do not enter an electrical power substation, or other marked areas. With its 22000 watts, it is powerful enough to provide energy supply for the entire home including all major appliances requiring higher wattage such as air conditioning, heating, TVs etc. Many homes are outfitted with the wrong electrical panels, either because the panel they use is too small to support the electricity they use or the panel is outdated.</p>

Lightning may strike at any moment, causing a power surge that could damage or destroy your TV, personal computer and other everyday electrical appliances in your home.

Electrical systems used in older homes weren't designed to handle today's electrical demands with things like home entertainment systems, computers, and home security systems.</p>
<p>Make sure you attach the correct wires to the correct screws. Almost every building has an electrical power, communications, lighting, and control system that is installed during construction and maintained after that. A short circuit is generally an abnormal low-resistance current, in between two nodes of an electrical circuit that are usually meant to have different voltages.

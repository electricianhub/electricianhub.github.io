Generac generators make for a good, cheaper alternative to some of the more expensive brands. First and foremost of these reasons is their ability to use less power than other commercial lighting fixtures, making them very cost effective from an energy conservation perspective.</p>

The controller is faulty if there are no voltmeter readings on all three of the terminal pairs. The generator is paired with a transfer switch containing a predetermined number of circuits based on the generator's kW power rating.

Breaker and fuse box panels are complicated and delicate pieces of equipment. Some prefer to have slightly brighter lights that allow them to see their entire yard, this gives them a sense of security; others prefer a much more subdued light that creates an ambience rather than a light show. An automatic backup generator turns on within seconds of the power going out, and when the return of utility power is sensed, it automatically shuts down and returns to standby mode, ready for the next outage.</p>

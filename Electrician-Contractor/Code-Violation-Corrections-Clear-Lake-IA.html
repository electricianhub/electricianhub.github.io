<p>A limited electrical contractor will require a Montana licensed journeyman electrician as the responsible party and limits the electrical work to residential construction consisting of less than five living units in a single structure. However, you may be able to shorten your apprenticeship by getting credit for some of the classroom hours from your pre-apprenticeship program.

Until you become reasonably competent, it is best to practice troubleshooting in a controlled environment.</p>
<p>Having identified your power source and have cut the opening for your new outlet you are ready to begin wiring. On average, permanent standby generators produce anywhere from 5,000 to 20,000 watts depending upon the model you choose for your home's electrical needs.

These surges can often be small and inconsequential, but there is a risk of your expensive electronics and home appliances to be damaged or completely taken out by a power surge. Another helpful thing you can do is install surge protectors. Even if you were to upgrade your electrical panel on your own, that in and of itself won't increase the power supply to your home.</p>

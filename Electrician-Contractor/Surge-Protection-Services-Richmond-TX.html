A home backup generator delivers power directly to your home's electrical system, backing up your entire home or just the most essential items. Power cords should not be stapled into place or run under rugs and furniture. Most LED lights require 12-volt DC volt transformers while most incandescent lights require 12-volt AC transformers.</p>

The electrician will reattach the wiring from the existing circuits to the new box. This is a box that contains all the other parts of the socket - the wires and terminals. On a commercial installation, an electrician would do a cost savings and payback analysis for the company. When it comes to your electrical system, Bacon is transparent, honest, reliable, and provides you with the customer service you deserve.</p>

If you can't get the transformer close enough to your light fixtures you will need to up the voltage that your line carries. Worn cords and damaged plugs increase your risk of both fires and electrical shocks.</p>

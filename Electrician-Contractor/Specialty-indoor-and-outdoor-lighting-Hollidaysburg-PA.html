Our experienced team can bring your landscape to life at night by lighting patios, arbors, steps, decks, walkways, trees, driveways and planting beds.</p>

<p>These wires supply power to your low voltage circuit. Uplights are installed on the ground to cast a cascade of light on plants, shrubs, trees or landscape structures. It acts as a semi-conductor to divert excess electrical power to a grounding wire. When you pull power from an existing receptacle for a new receptacle, the electrical code requires AFCI protection for both the existing wiring and the new wiring. One example of this sort of lighting is the High line Calo Spot 4 low voltage cable lighting from Bruck Lighting.</p>
<p>The greatest way to show everything off after dark has settled is to set up landscape lights around the entire area. As a result, this has meant the development of some of the quietest standby generators recently.

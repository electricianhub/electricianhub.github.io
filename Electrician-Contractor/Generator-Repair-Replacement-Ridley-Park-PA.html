And if you are not sure what a wire is connected to, just turn the breaker off, disconnect the wire and put a wago or a nut at the end of it and turn the circuit back on and see what is not working.

These surges can often be small and inconsequential, but there is a risk of your expensive electronics and home appliances to be damaged or completely taken out by a power surge. Another helpful thing you can do is install surge protectors. Even if you were to upgrade your electrical panel on your own, that in and of itself won't increase the power supply to your home.</p>

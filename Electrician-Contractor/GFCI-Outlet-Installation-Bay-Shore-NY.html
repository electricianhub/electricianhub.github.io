<h2>How To Hire Emergency Electrician in Bay Shore</h2>
<p>An electrical surge is the equivalent to all of a sudden having extra blood and it bursting through your body, damaging all of the sensitive veins and capillaries. Transformers using 12 volts can be easily installed by the homeowner, whereas in the case of a 120 volt system requires professional installation by a licensed electrical contractor and in some state you have to go the cost of a permit as well.

If you don't have enough circuits to serve all of your electrical equipment, consult an electrician or power supplier; you will probably need a larger service entrance.</p>
<p>If your two plug ins (two electrical receptacles) are located in the same electrical box (we call this a "quad" electrical receptacle installation since each individual receptacle provides connections for two wall plugs), you'll want to wire the hot and neutral to one pair of screws on the first receptacle, and use short black and white jumper wires to connect the the proper terminals on the first receptacle to the second one in the same box. If the outlets ARE half hot, with one half of it switched, it will not be possible to reproduce that with the new outlets.</p>

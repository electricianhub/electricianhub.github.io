<p>Take a home theater surge protector as an example. A great deal of electrical maintenance work depends on the ability of maintenance electricians to read and understand electrical diagrams.

Step and pathway lights are popular for lining walkways, and in-ground well lights add a remarkable upward glow to water or architectural features.</p>

Prints, drawings, and schematics are useful in determining the location of equipment, identifying its components, and specifying the proper sequence of operation.

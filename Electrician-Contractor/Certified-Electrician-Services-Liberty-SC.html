<p>Zinsco electrical panels pose fire and shock hazards. If you are looking for wiring or electrical work to be done indoors, or inside your house, look for a residential electric business or an electrician who is experienced in home wiring. With a more reliable, high capacity electrical panel, we can ensure that your system is up to code and put important safeguards into place. And you don't change the colors because the outlet is mounted in what most would consider "upside-down"; the black wires always go to the brass screws, not the silver ones.</p>
<p>Residential electrician licenses are issued by the Board. But it is also very important that you are aware of the limitations these protectors come with. This makes them much more common for large-scale outdoor projects, including landscape lighting projects. Indoor reduced voltage lighting is also very affordable and convenient to use. If you can't get the transformer close enough to your light fixtures you will need to up the voltage that your line carries. Worn cords and damaged plugs increase your risk of both fires and electrical shocks.</p>

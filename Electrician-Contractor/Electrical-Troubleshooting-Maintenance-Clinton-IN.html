In one of the light vendor's manuals, I saw a table of allowed wattages for lighting as a function of distance and wire diameter. Mike, if your comment is a question of how to put in more than one outlet along a 12 foot wall, yes it's perfectly permitted to exceed the minimum number of receptacles along a wall.

<p>Whatever your lighting needs may be, we can take care of it, including providing repair, installation, and replacement services.

<p>I have a few tips for keeping your landscape lighting wires safe, one tip I'll show you, most do it yourselfers would never think of.

Wiring a receptacle so that one half is a typical receptacle and the other half is controlled by a switch is commonly called a split-wired receptacle.</p>
<p>If you want a whole house generator that can power 90-100% of your home on natural gas or propane, call a pro from the start. Plugging too many items into outlets is the cause of many house fires. Older homes may have small electrical panels with minimal loads that may not be able to service high-power, modern appliances. When electrical contractors have a good understanding of what a job involves, they can then make plans on how to proceed. I did look into a generator and remember that all Honda gasoline generators can be made to run on propane with one of these conversion kits.</p>

<p>The National Electrical Code (NEC) and local building codes regulate the types of wire and cable that can be used in specific electrical applications, as well as the manner of installation. Instead, splice the neutrals from the feed to the GFCI and the under-sink outlet together, splice a short jumper to the black feed to the GFCI, and connect that jumper to a new switch. If necessary, remove all the wires but one, check the outlet for power, and then use a different wire.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for helping, I found where the main power comes from and it's hooked to the GFI that's next to the switch, so I did a pigtail of the (hot) black wire to the switch and then the other black wire that runs from the outlet from underneath the sink to the other bronze screw on the switch. Depending on application, proper installation requires meeting noise, fuel storage, building and electrical codes, and emission ordinances. Upon sensing the return to the utility power source, the generator automatically shuts down and returns to standby mode.</p>

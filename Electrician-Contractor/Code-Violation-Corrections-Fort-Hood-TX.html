If you have electronics plugged into power strips, make sure they have surge protection as well (not all power strips do!). Circuit breakers are designed to trip when overloaded or when there is a short circuit or electrical problem. Use a portable ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) cord if your outdoor outlets don't have GFCIs.</p>
<p>A regular round electrical box isn't sturdy enough to support the weight and absorb the vibration of a ceiling fan. Electricians usually start their days around 7am at the gang box‚Äù, which is a colloquial term in construction for the tool box with all of the materials needed for the project.

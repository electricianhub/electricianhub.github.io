<p>Remember extension cords are intended to be temporary; they are not intended as permanent household wiring. The first step in troubleshooting an existing circuit that has developed trouble is to understand that circuit and to understand the operation of the machine it controls. But before any homeowner delves into any kind of electrical services, they should first know the variety of light installation problems that they might encounter. After any electrical wiring issues in your home have been repaired, take some time to learn about electricity and what to do in the case of an emergency.</p>

You will also need a firm understanding of Ohms law (Volt x Amps = Watts) and how it works in relation to laying out the wiring for the lighting system. These generators are intended for portable backup use and require regular maintenance and tests to ensure they are ready for an outage.

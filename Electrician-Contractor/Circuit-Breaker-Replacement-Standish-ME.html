A power surge will travel through any wire into a house, leaving common appliances and sensitive electronic equipment vulnerable to serious damage. This approach is general in nature allowing it to be used on any type of electrical circuit.</p>
<p>Journeyman Electrician: Completion of a vocational or apprenticeship program. With a switch controlling a receptacle it is possible that one cable, with white, black and ground wires, connects to a receptacle.

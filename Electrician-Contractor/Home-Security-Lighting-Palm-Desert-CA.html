Mike, if your comment is a question of how to put in more than one outlet along a 12 foot wall, yes it's perfectly permitted to exceed the minimum number of receptacles along a wall.

As a general rule houses are not supplied with enough power sockets or switches for additional lighting. Landscape fixtures are also available in LED, which will use far less power than traditional halogen or incandescent lighting. Electrical panels have evolved over time, and many designs that were common in the mid-20th century no longer meet contemporary electrical needs.</p>

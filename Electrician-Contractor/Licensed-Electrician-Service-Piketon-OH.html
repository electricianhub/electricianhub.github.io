If you see a white wire on the existing switch, that is not a neutral. You'll need to have the generator, transfer switch and subpanel professionally installed. There are many reasons to do so.

<p>Standard electrical code wiring practices in the United States require the grounding conductor to be green or a non-insulated bare wire. Fusing on 120V circuits powering lights, electrical receptacles, and other such devices. Homes built before 1965 typically have ungrounded two-pronged outlets, while newer construction will usually have three-pronged outlets, which include a hot, neutral and ground wire. Whether you're looking to upgrade your home's electricity or need an electric company for your new construction, our certified, licensed electricians will get the job done right.</p>

<p>On-site fleet repair services are also available. Working with the breaker box is stressful for many homeowners, as it can affect the electricity throughout your entire home. Midway through the day, electricians will take a lunch break, and regroup after to continue the day's project. Usually a bad outdoor lighting design is a result of illuminating the scenic view of your home too much or too little. The Canadian Electrical Code (CEC) details the minimum electrical service size should be by using a "demand calculation".</p>

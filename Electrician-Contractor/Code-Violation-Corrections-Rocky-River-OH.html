If you continually have blown fuses, you should have a professional electrician perform an inspection of your home to pinpoint the problem. When a transient voltage occurs on the circuit, the SPD moves into a state of conduction (or low impedance) and diverts the transient energy and current back to its source or ground This limits or clamps the voltage amplitude to a safer level.</p>

<p>Take a look at how the outlet is wired up.

These certification providers have databases of qualifying contractors in each category and field of practice, so you can choose the right electrical contractor for your needs.

Old homes and properties usually have hidden electrical wiring problems, which could remain undetected unless a thorough property inspection is performed. Electricians have a higher rate of injuries and illnesses than the national average. It certainly doesn't require the same level of attention as standby whole house generators.</p>
<p>The exception here is if the outlet that's controlled by the light switch is only connected to that light switch and there aren't any other wires. Here's what electrical cable looks like inside. Oftentimes, the light problem isn't from the light fixture itself, but from the light switch.

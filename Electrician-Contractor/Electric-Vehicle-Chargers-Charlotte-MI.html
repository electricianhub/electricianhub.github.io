So doing it properly often meant hiring a landscape architect or a contractor who specialized in landscape lighting. We offer reliable and affordable lighting fixture repairs and installations in New Jersey in areas such as Middletown, Howell, Trenton, Elizabeth, Tom's River, and Old Bridge.</p>
<p>Unscrew the nuts and the wires should come apart easily. High Pressure Sodium (HPS) commercial lighting fixtures gained huge popularity in the 1970s to meet the needs of a powerful, yet super efficient, source of HID lighting.

Today, the company focuses its consulting services in three main markets, which are power, mining and materials, and oil and gas.</p>

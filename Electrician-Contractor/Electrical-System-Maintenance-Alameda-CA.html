Having a breaker trip saves you from potential electrical fires. Generators have two components, an engine that burns fuel such as, gas or propane and a generator that turns the power into electricity. The most obvious and important is to shut off the power at the breaker because an electric shock can kill you. For business owners, it is essential to hire an electrician with experience working in commercial buildings.</p>

Breakers Won't Remain Reset: If you notice that a reset circuit breaker in your electrical panel won't stay reset or restore power, then it's very likely that you have a faulty service panel.</p>

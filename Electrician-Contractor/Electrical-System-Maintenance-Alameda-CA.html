Having a breaker trip saves you from potential electrical fires. Generators have two components, an engine that burns fuel such as, gas or propane and a generator that turns the power into electricity. The most obvious and important is to shut off the power at the breaker because an electric shock can kill you. For business owners, it is essential to hire an electrician with experience working in commercial buildings.</p>
<p>State professional licensing boards usually post specific requirements online. 4. Keep your used and unused cords tidy and secure to prevent damage.

<p>A plus for running propane over NG is that you will get the full 20KW out of the genset rather than a 20% reduction (e.g. 18KW) using NG.

Breakers Won't Remain Reset: If you notice that a reset circuit breaker in your electrical panel won't stay reset or restore power, then it's very likely that you have a faulty service panel.</p>

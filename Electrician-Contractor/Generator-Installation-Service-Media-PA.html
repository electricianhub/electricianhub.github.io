In many homes, if a room does not have an overhead light, most builders will install a switch that controls half of the outlets in the room.

As an unlicensed individual, legally you can't charge for electrician work because you won't be able to pull a permit or schedule an inspection.</p>
<p>However, there are local electrician licensing requirements so make sure to check with your local jurisdiction before you start work.

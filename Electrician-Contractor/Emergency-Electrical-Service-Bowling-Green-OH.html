Troubleshooting variable speed drive (VSD) systems effectively almost always requires in-depth knowledge of the controller, but it also requires broad knowledge of the systems that the drives are often a part of.

<p>11 18 19 The first six methods listed operate primarily by diverting unwanted surge energy away from the protected load, through a protective component connected in a parallel (or shunted) topology.

<p>After completing this course, participants should know the characteristics and basic operation of a typical battery system and its components. But it's important to not overdo outdoor lighting, whether it's LED landscape lighting, lanterns, or even outdoor floor lamps.

Outdoor solar lights are a little more expensive to purchase but they are much easier to install.

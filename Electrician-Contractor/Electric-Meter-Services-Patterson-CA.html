<p>Breaker panels and fuse box panels are complex and delicate, and it's never a good idea to try and DIY your breaker panel upgrade or replacement. Nowadays people are turning to energy efficient lighting technologies to accomplish this by using lower voltage landscape lighting. The bulb's intense heat can scorch or melt the socket and insulation on the fixture's wires, which increases the risk of arcing — sparks that jump through the air from one wire to another — a chief cause of electrical fires.</p>

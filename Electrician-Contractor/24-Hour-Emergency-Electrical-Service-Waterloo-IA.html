<p>If the power comes to the light outlet first, and then goes to the switch, then this can be done fairly easily as long as the outlet is accessible, isn't too full of wires already because the unswitched power is available as well as the switched wire that is connected to the light. Our homes totally rely on electric energy to supply us with food, light, entertainment, heating and cooling. The arc does not have to reach ground wire, it can merely be a loose Hot or Neutral located on a switch screw, outlet, fan motor etc.</p>

<p>In today's world we rely on all kinds of sophisticated electronic equipment; not only for our entertainment, but to fulfill the basic needs of our daily lives. However, surge protective panels or strips alone are not enough to fight damaging power surges. Finding out that your standby generator isn't working after a storm or power outage is too late. For example, if each light is 5 watts and you have 10 lights, your total wattage is 50. You want a transformer that is 20% larger than what you need.

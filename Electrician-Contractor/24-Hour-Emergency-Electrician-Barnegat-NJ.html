<p>One of the most common uses for landscape lighting is for security purposes and keeping a building safe, whether it's a home, and office, or a whole are of buildings and structures. If your heating or AC is controlled by electric power, you will lose this feature during an outage. Successfully replacing a circuit breaker or a breaker box requires a skilled and experienced professional.

Simply plug a Switcheroo into your switched outlet, and then another Switcheroo into as many outlets that you want to turn on and off with your existing switch. Some older homes will have electrical panels that are not suited to handle the electrical demands of modern homes.</p>

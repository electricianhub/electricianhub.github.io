For example, if each light is 5 watts and you have 10 lights, your total wattage is 50. You want a transformer that is 20% larger than what you need. Attach the loose end of the new wire to the silver screw on the new outlet. Uncover the ends of the cable wire close to the transformer and connect them to the transformer's terminals.</p>

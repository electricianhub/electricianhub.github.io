<p>When electric problems occur, electrical wiring should be replaced right away. When you pass the master electrician examination, it replaces your existing electrical certification.

Its diminutive structure, however, does not mean that its surge protection capabilities have been compromised. Simply plug a Switcheroo into your switched outlet, and then another Switcheroo into as many outlets that you want to turn on and off with your existing switch. Some older homes will have electrical panels that are not suited to handle the electrical demands of modern homes.</p>

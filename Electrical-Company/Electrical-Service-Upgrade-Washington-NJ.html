<p>Electricians will use their extensive experience in domestic lighting to provide a solution that is right for your home. This is the maximum capacity of your entire home's electrical system, in amps. Attach the first wire you unscrew to the same-colored screw on the new switch as it was on the old; do the same with the second.

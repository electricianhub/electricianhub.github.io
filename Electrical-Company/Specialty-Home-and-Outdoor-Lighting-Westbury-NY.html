<h2>How To Hire Emergency Electrician Contractor in Westbury</h2>
<p>The role of electrical contractors is critical in residential, commercial and industrial installations. Hanging lanterns and torch lights can add curb appeal to your house while also brightening up your front walkway. The electrical tape is for labeling wires, so you can skip it or use another labeling method that works for you. Consequently it is quite common to find a white wire in a switch box that is the hot LINE and the black wire is the switch leg connected to the LOAD.

When a surge protective device senses a transient voltage spike, it uses internal components called Metal Oxide Varistors (MOVs) that act like magnets for the excess voltage, and sends it to the load center's ground wire before it can reach your home's connected electronics.</p>

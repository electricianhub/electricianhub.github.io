<p>A surge protector protects your electrical equipment from internal component damage caused by power surges. Though it is not a common practice among homeowners to explore what is inside their electrical service panels, it is a good idea to evaluate the inner section of the electrical panel, taking all due caution. Electrical and wiring contractors paid median salaries of $52,190.

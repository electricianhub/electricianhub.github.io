<p>Currently, it's estimated that less than 3 percent of American households have home standby generators installed, so this is an enormous market opportunity.

Normal Voltage (120V) wiring: "normal" building electrical wires, typically #14 gauge (for 15-Amp circuits), is used to carry electrical power into and then out of the low-voltage relay and on to the light, electrical receptacle, or other device that the switch and relay are intended to control.</p>
<p>This allows the sharp prongs inside the connectors to pierce the cable and make contact with the wires inside. You also will not need to fumble with extension cords when you use a standby, since the power will flow directly to your electrical lines.

<p>If the light switch was improperly wired, it will get hot. According to the Centers for Disease Control, the most common injuries caused by contact with electrical energy are electric shock, burns, and falls. Because multiple conductors bundled in a cable cannot dissipate heat as easily as single insulated conductors, those circuits are always rated at a lower " ampacity ". Tables in electrical safety codes give the maximum allowable current based on size of conductor, voltage potential, insulation type and thickness, and the temperature rating of the cable itself.</p>

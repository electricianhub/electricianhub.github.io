<p>A single lightning strike or other power spiking occurrences that could disrupt the power structure near or in your area can cause damage to expensive appliances. Ask all landscape artists and architects of a great way to improve the over-all aesthetic appeal of your yard and they will all reply with outdoor lighting. If you see a white wire on the existing switch, that is not a neutral. You'll need to have the generator, transfer switch and subpanel professionally installed. There are many reasons to do so. A professional electrical will be able to assess your situation to let you know if you need an upgrade. Other inexpensive home standby generators from different manufacturers are also being retailed here.</p>

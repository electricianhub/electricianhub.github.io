<p>Cut this wire so as to allow it to be connected to ANY breaker position in the panel - plus a little slack. Lutron and Touch-Plate offer upgraded systems that would allow you to continue to use your home's wiring, but would require new panels, relays, light switches, and other adaptations. Pigtail wires will require the use of silicone-filled wire nuts for connections. Seriously consider hiring an electrician who will allow you to do lots of the mundane work such as nailing up the boxes, running the cables between them, and even allowing you to connect up many of the switches and outlets after the drywall is up. But allow the electrician to do all the truly complex aspects that only come with years of experience.</p>

After that time you expose yourself to potential electrical dangers by overloading your system with the latest electrical equipment.</p>

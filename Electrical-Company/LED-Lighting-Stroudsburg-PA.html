<p>Sadly, some electrical service companies don't answer the phone after hours.

A circuit breaker is always sized to the load that it serves and the wire size it is supposed to protect.</p>
<p>Electricity flows through the hot wire, entering the outlet and then into whatever is plugged into it, and then returns through the neutral wire.

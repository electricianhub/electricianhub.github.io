<p>Depending on total wattage, an inverter generator can be used for many emergency situations during a home power outage. Electricity flows through the hot wire, entering the switch and then into the light fixture, and then returns back through the neutral wire. A power surge will travel through any wire into a house, leaving common appliances and sensitive electronic equipment vulnerable to serious damage. This approach is general in nature allowing it to be used on any type of electrical circuit.</p>
<p>Moreover, frequent power surges of a lower intensity, while usually undetected and seldom strong enough to cause immediate damage, can, over time, degrade the performance and decrease the lifespan of your computer. Remember that with simple power management” techniques, a small generator can provide adequate power for home or recreational applications. Improperly used extension cords, faulty or damaged wiring, and poorly insulated wires can lead to electrical fires.</p>

Low voltage lighting requires a transformer to reduce the voltage to below 50 volts, most commonly 12 volts or 24 volts. Your home has different types of electrical circuits installed that serve different purposes.</p>
<p>Light fixtures are usually placed 10 feet from the transformer and each other.

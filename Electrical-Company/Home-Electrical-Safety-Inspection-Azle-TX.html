<p>Purchasing inexpensive home standby generators will entirely depend on a number of things. The second method of wiring middle-of-run receptacles is to connect them to the circuit wires via "pigtails."

In the diagram, the black is hot, the white is neutral is white, and the brown looking wire is a bare copper ground. The low-voltage wiring system uses small-gauge copper wires connected to low-voltage switches to switch on and off relays which in turn control the operation of lights and where desired, electrical receptacles, and other 120-Volt equipment in homes.</p>

<h2>How To Hire Licensed Electrician Service in Cape Girardeau</h2>
<p>Our licensed, professional electricians service commercial properties all across Central Texas, whether it's changing light bulbs or addressing a location's entire electrical service. Lighting is great for security also and electricians will offer solutions for security lighting.

Mike, if your comment is a question of how to put in more than one outlet along a 12 foot wall, yes it's perfectly permitted to exceed the minimum number of receptacles along a wall. Add another wire to the black wires. For another $1,000, an automatic transfer switch could do all that work for them.</p>
<p>When an outage occurs, the switch is triggered (usually automatically in the case of an automatic transfer switch, but some models require a manual switch flip) and switches from utility power to the generator, which turns on automatically when the switch engages. Since a traditional knob and tube electrical circuit lacks a ground wire, these circuits should be upgraded to new wire whenever possible. An electrician can help make wiring a light switch hassle-free.</p>

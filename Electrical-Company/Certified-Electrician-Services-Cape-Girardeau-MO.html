<h2>How To Hire Licensed Electrician Service in Cape Girardeau</h2>
<p>Our licensed, professional electricians service commercial properties all across Central Texas, whether it's changing light bulbs or addressing a location's entire electrical service.

Mike, if your comment is a question of how to put in more than one outlet along a 12 foot wall, yes it's perfectly permitted to exceed the minimum number of receptacles along a wall. Add another wire to the black wires. For another $1,000, an automatic transfer switch could do all that work for them.</p>

Since a traditional knob and tube electrical circuit lacks a ground wire, these circuits should be upgraded to new wire whenever possible. An electrician can help make wiring a light switch hassle-free.</p>

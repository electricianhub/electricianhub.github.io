In the United States, electricians are divided into two primary categories: linemen , who work on electric utility company distribution systems at higher voltages, and wiremen, who work with the lower voltages utilized inside buildings.</p>
<p>If you've gone through our home backup generator reviews and still want another fuel-economical generator, then this is your best bet.

<p>Surge protectors protect your electronics from power surges in your electrical system. The main electrical panel is the central distribution point for all branch circuits of the house. Where water may be present but direct immersion is not an issue, the voltage level is a maximum 30 volts for non-pulsating dc and 12.4 volts peak for pulsating dc in the 10 to 200 hertz range.

Natural gas is rarely interrupted in most places, but you'll also require a plumber to come out and make sure that your generator is hooked up safely to the line in addition to an electrician.</p>

AC motors represent industry's workhorse in small, medium and large size applications. Based on sound business practices and management, Tri-City provides vast bonding capacity and human resources for projects of all sizes. Whether we installed it or if you purchased your generator elsewhere, we're happy to come out for routine maintenance or full service repair.</p>
<p>The Standard for Low Voltage Landscape Lighting Systems, UL 1838, covers the safety requirements for landscape lighting systems; the Standard for Low Voltage Lighting Systems, UL 2108, covers incandescent luminaires and luminaire fittings; and the Standard for Low Voltage Lighting Systems for Use in Recreational Vehicles, UL 234, covers luminaires for recreational vehicles.

When you plug in a device (e.g., a power tool), the electricity takes the easiest path from the plug-in, to the tool, and back to the power source.

Once public power is restored, your generator will automatically disengage, ready to work for you the next time it's needed.

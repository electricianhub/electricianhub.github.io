But the catch is that, unlike an ordinary switch, some of these new switches require a neutral to operate correctly.</p>
<p>Be sure to test the voltage of wires and circuits before touching them. With our designs, you will often not notice the light source itself but will only see the area that it is highlighting. This is the place to discuss electrical wiring. If a circuit breaker is out or blows a fuse, a surge protector provides internal protection and protects against device and exterior surges.

<p>An electrical surge is the equivalent to all of a sudden having extra blood and it bursting through your body, damaging all of the sensitive veins and capillaries. Transformers using 12 volts can be easily installed by the homeowner, whereas in the case of a 120 volt system requires professional installation by a licensed electrical contractor and in some state you have to go the cost of a permit as well.

<p>Not only that, landscape lighting makes your property look more luxurious and expensive, leading to increased value. With the average lifespan of a home now greater than 35 years and technology's rapid rate of progression, the answer is likely no. Today's gadgets and appliances easily overload electrical systems in many of today's older homes, causing issues that could easily be prevented with a new electrical panel. If your home or business facility's electrical panel is beyond repair, it's time to consider a full replacement or upgrade.</p>

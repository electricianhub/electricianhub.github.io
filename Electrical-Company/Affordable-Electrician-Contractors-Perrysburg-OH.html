The average American home is hit by more than 20 power surges every single day. However, if the device is sensitive to fluctuations and performance is sorely affected by fluctuations, you need to hook it up to a surge protector.</p>

<p>Electricians must go through at least four years of training as an apprentice, followed by the licensing their state requires.

<h2>How To Hire Residential Electrician in Holtsville</h2>
<p>Too many households across northern New Jersey have suffered through severe weather events in recent years and know all too well the pain of losing power for extended periods of time. Licensed electricians have the skills and knowledge needed to keep your home safe and in compliance with electrical codes. Master - As a master electrician, you could work as a foreman or team leader supervising journeyman and apprentice electricians. A merger between Charles Coffin's Thomson-Houston Electric Company and Thomas Edison's Edison General Electric Company in 1892 led to the creation of GE. Edison's company had by then constructed America's first central power station in New York.</p>

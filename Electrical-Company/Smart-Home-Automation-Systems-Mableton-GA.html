<p>Permanent home standby generators are your ideal partner in providing solutions to that much needed backup power during electricity outages. Here's MY conundrum… I want to build myself a custom POWER BAR or two, to add outlets into my bench and desk areas. Turn off the mains electricity, and then remove all of the circuits from the panel.

Since a traditional knob and tube electrical circuit lacks a ground wire, these circuits should be upgraded to new wire whenever possible. An electrician can help make wiring a light switch hassle-free.</p>

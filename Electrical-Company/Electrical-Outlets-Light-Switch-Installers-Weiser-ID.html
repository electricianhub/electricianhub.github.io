<h2>How To Hire Licensed Electrician in Weiser</h2>
<p>Circuit breakers protect the electrical circuits in your home by stopping the flow of electricity if there's an overload or other electrical fault. A Generac managed whole-house generator manages the power requirements of each of your individual appliances. Because installing individual switches and their wiring is lower in cost than installing a 120-volt-rated switch and wire in the same location, a low-voltage-wired home may have multiple switches in multiple locations all controlling the same light or other device. They also do not have a main breaker switch to stop all power from flowing into the panel.</p>
<p>Transfer switches are commonly included with standby generators, but rarely included with portable or inverter generators.

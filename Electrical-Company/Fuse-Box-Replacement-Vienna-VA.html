<p>Every household should be equipped with a whole house surge protector. Master Electrician - You must show proof of eight years of work experience. An associate degree in electrical technology is perhaps the most popular option for future electricians who choose to attend two-year programs. Once the system detects that you have been disconnected from your utility grid, the generator starts up and transfers its power to the home's electrical panel automatically. When that "other" switch is used to turn lights off, it was "down" and is now switched "up".</p>

It starts at about $3,000 for the 6- to 8-kw models and reaches from $5,000 to $10,000 for the 11- to 20-kw units. The variety of light fixtures and lighting accessories has grown exponentially.</p>

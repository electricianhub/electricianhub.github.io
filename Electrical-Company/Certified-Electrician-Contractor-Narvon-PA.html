We tend to use so many appliances in our day to day lives that a single power outlet is often not adequate; however, care should be taken while using double power boards or adapters.</p>
<p>Also, owing to the increase in blackouts due to the increased stress on the power grid, experts are advising that all households have a standby generator.

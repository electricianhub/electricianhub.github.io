By paying a small amount each month along with your Reliant electricity bill, you don't have to worry about the costs of an unexpected power surge. Your transformer should be able to handle the total number of watts connected to it (as determined by adding up the watts needed by the number of fixtures connected to that transformer).</p>
<p>To access the wiring, gently pull the switches out of the electrical boxes. People often think of power strips when they hear "surge protection". Check electric cords often for damage. One of the deterrents to more market adoption, especially for standby generators, may be price: John Hoch, the president of Power Equipment Direct, which sells home generators, says that a home standby generator will cost between about $2,000 and $5,000 or more (depending on power and size), not including installation.</p>

This whole-home generator is able to generate up to 20,000 watts of power using propane (LPG) or 18,000 watts using natural gas.

<p>For instance, instead of 14 AWG ( American wire gauge ) copper wire, aluminium wiring would need to be 12 AWG on a typical 15 ampere lighting circuit, though local building codes vary. It's also worth considering the placement of light switches if family members are getting older or have lost mobility and would have trouble reaching a switch while seated in a wheelchair. A digital timer may be used for more complex lighting systems where multiple start times are required including start times on different days of the week.</p>

<p>Replacing damaged appliances and electronics can cost thousands of dollars. Liquid-cooled - These generators can handle prolonged outage periods as they are typically liquid-cooled. These cables were similar to underground telegraph and telephone cables of the time.

<p>If you live in an older home, you may have outlets that don't have a third or grounded‚Äù hole. This is especially important if you have small children in the house; you'll want to keep all of the electrical outlets covered. Remember that even if an appliance is off‚Äù if it is still plugged in, it is still connected to electricity, therefore a potential shock hazard. Some electrical contractors specialize in maintenance and repair. At the same time electronics devices need the maximum protection that is available.</p>

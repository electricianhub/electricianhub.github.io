<p>Automatic standby generators are complex machines designed to work in emergency situations. In the event of a blackout, there is a specific kind of surge protector that can prevent loss of important information by acting as a storage cell for power, giving you enough time to save your work and power down your machine. Most sensitive electronic equipment (i.e. televisions, stereos, computers, faxes, printers, etc.) may not tolerate that voltage and will require a second line of defense provided by a point-of-use surge arrestor”.</p>

Electrical services are the backbone of any modern home—they also happen to be the bread and butter of our company. To keep a house running smoothly, the proper rating of electrical panel can eliminate tripped circuit breakers and prevent fires. PART 2 OF 2: In this video, Master electrician Scott Caron installs a new panel to complete a service upgrade.</p>
<p>Boxes with fuses can only handle 30-60 amps which isn't enough for newer households which require 200 amps. With today's reliance on electrical appliances, many homes are not capable of handling the amount of power needed solve that problem by letting Canaan Tech Mechanical upgrade your main electrical panel. A drawback to portable generators during a severe weather outage is they do not come on automatically, are manually operated and require the use of an electric or pull cord starter.</p>

A proper plastic covered wires- called NMC or Non Metallic Sheathed Cable- are so far considered the ideal one for indoor wiring. The cost of a sub-panel is usually less than a full-sized breaker panel due to its smaller size, lower amperage rating, and fewer circuit breakers. Electrical contractor licenses typically need to be renewed on an annual basis. In order to do this, you must have good wiring design (load-wise) and ensure power sources are situated around the property to allow all wire runs to be within 200' of the transformer.</p>
<p>In USA the ‘live' wire is coloured black or red, the ‘neutral' is coloured white and the ‘earth' is either bare wire or green. Watch out: while the electrical receptacle ground may also be electrically connected to the metal strap that mounts the receptacle to the junction box (photo at left), and while the junction box may be metal, do not rely on the receptacle mounting screws and receptacle strap-to-box contact to serve as the grounding connection.

For commercial installs, we can set the generators to send diagnostic information to the IT department or another internal department via email or text.

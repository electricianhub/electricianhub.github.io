<p>Building a wind generator has many advantages. Circuit breakers are more convenient to change - just flip a switch instead of changing a fuse. The lighting designer used spotlights for the columns and set brightness to balance the illumination from the coach lights on either side of the door. Some dimmer switches use a resistor to dim the light and it is common for them to get warm.

It plugs into a GFCI-protected outdoor electrical outlet and steps down the house current from 120 volts to 12 volts. The amendment specifies the use of new cable colours for all new fixed wiring electrical installations in the UK. These new colours are sometimes referred to as Harmonized colours. If there is no ground wire at the house wiring, then a three prong outlet should not be installed.</p>
<p>Although most lights must be assembled, it's easy to put them together. Screw the switch back into the box with the two Phillips screws. Get an electrical engineer to estimate how much amperage you need to add before planning to install central heat and air or new appliances such as an electric range, a dryer, and others, which use 240-volt power. This is useful to check that there is no current flow through the wire (the circuit is dead) before you start to dismantle the old switch.</p>

Either way, you will need what is called "3-wire cable" (black, red, white, and green OR metal all sheathed together: yes I know that makes 4 wires, but that's what it's called!) to connect the two boxes.</p>
<p>Whether you need one technician or an entire team of electrical specialist, all of our staff is courteous and well trained. You can be fined $22,000 as an individual or $110,000 as a company for doing unlicensed electrical work. A training licence is valid for the period of apprenticeship or traineeship.

Alternatively, you can wire the switch up in such a way that only that single outlet will be controlled by the switch, but other outlets in the circuit will still stay powered on constantly.</p>

The 8 and 10 gauge wire is mainly used to extend the distance from the transformer to your first fixture on that run.

<p>Complete with swimming pool, spacious patio, landscaped pond and outdoor kitchen, this backyard is the ideal spot for outdoor entertaining. With LED lighting, the possibilities for decoration and lighting are practically endless. This cannot be accomplished with a single 12-2 wire - it will require a 12-3 from the switch to one outlet and a 12-3 to the other one. Our homes are packed with electrical appliances - from microwave and toaster to refrigerator and television set, but there are safeguards that need to be adhered to prevent the danger arising from electrocution.</p>

<p>And power outages can threaten the very lives of those who depend on electrically powered medical equipment to stay alive and well.

<p>Another option is to wire the lights in a loop, with the wire returning to the transformer. If it was you have two circuits in each box and outlet, and very likely have 240 volts in the outlet boxes, which is OK but any such box (and outlet) needs labeled indicating that. This should also include any trees, garden decor, or special features of the landscaping Taking measurements will also help when it comes time to purchase the lighting fixtures, particularly if you are going to use low voltage lighting, because you need to have the right amount of cabling for the entire project.</p>

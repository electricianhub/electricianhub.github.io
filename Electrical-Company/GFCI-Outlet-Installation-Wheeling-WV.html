<p>Surge protectors protect your electronics from power surges in your electrical system. The main electrical panel is the central distribution point for all branch circuits of the house. Where water may be present but direct immersion is not an issue, the voltage level is a maximum 30 volts for non-pulsating dc and 12.4 volts peak for pulsating dc in the 10 to 200 hertz range.

The electrician may be able to cut back the damaged wiring, install a junction box, and extend the old circuit to the new electrical panel.</p>

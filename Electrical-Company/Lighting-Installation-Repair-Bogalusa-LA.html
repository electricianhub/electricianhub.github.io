Sterlite Power won 6 new transmission projects in Brazil to take the total capacity commitment to US$ 2 Billion.</p>
<p>This is the key to ensuring that your generator will perform when you need it the most and will not let you down upon the next power outage.

With the generator running, the switch closed, and the voltmeter probes attached to the current conductor and neutral conductor connections of the motor, the voltmeter will indicate the voltage potential at the motor.

<p>Every household should be equipped with a whole house surge protector. Master Electrician - You must show proof of eight years of work experience. An associate degree in electrical technology is perhaps the most popular option for future electricians who choose to attend two-year programs.

<p>Complete with swimming pool, spacious patio, landscaped pond and outdoor kitchen, this backyard is the ideal spot for outdoor entertaining. With LED lighting, the possibilities for decoration and lighting are practically endless.

In the national electrical code (NEC) which virtually all of the states recognize as the authority, a new fixture is an extension of the homes electrical system and requires an inspection by an underwriter.</p>

<p>When we have enough light, we don't really think about it. When we have improper lighting, however, it can be annoying and sometimes even unhealthy, putting unnecessary strain on the eyes.

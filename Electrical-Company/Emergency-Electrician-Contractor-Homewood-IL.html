<p>How many of us have waited until our computer, television, or other electrical apparatus was zapped by a rogue current and it resulted in replacement or repair due to an electrical surge?

Always best to disconnect power, but issues of insulation failure, lack of proper grounding, lack of GFCI, out-of-code wiring, generator operating without transfer switch, and other problems pose a risk to anyone working on electric power. Licensed electrician requirements also dictate proper insurance coverage - including Worker's Compensation, liability, and property damage.</p>

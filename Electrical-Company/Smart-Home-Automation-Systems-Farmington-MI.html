<p>Tell an adult to pull the plug from the outlet or turn off the power at the fuse box or circuit breaker. If a property is experiencing flickering lights, frequently blown circuits, or malfunctioning outlets, the electrical panel may need be inspected, especially if it is determined there are no wiring issues or issues with electrical appliances. It seems like it would be easier to convert the outlet to always-on, cap the wires, and install a wireless remote wall mount that could control the smart light switch I might add in place of the current dimmer.</p>
<p>The installation went very smoothly and took less time than I had anticipated. If this occurs, check the wiring and circuit breaker and contact an electrician. In Florida, the current minimum amperage for an electrical panel is a 100 amp service but many older homes do not even have this capacity. For lights, turn the light switch on and off to be sure. In some instances, such as some switch legs, the function of the wires will be indicated by colored electrical tape.</p>
<p>This creates a major safety issue for both the house and people who may come in contact with the wiring. Note: most states require a certain percentage of electrician training hours be spent in commercial or industrial installation. Low-voltage electrical system switches originally made by GE® or Remcon can be replaced with newer ones from Touch Plate but with some provisos which we explain below. Needless to say, a home standby generator will give you power when you need it most.</p>

<p>There is one aspect of electrical panel replacement that few people ever consider, and that's the immense savings you can receive. Old electric panels contain fuses, which can have problems. Because modern homes us a number of energy-hungry appliances, a 200-amp panel is the minimum we'd suggest. We use that information to determine if you need a panel change or an entire service upgrade. Sydney Electrical Service was really there for me when my kitchen power went out, luckily they were able to respond very fast and send out an Emergency Electrician within the hour.</p>
<h2>Home Energy Savings Sterling Massachusetts</h2>

<p>I have a few tips for keeping your landscape lighting wires safe, one tip I'll show you, most do it yourselfers would never think of. When planning your outdoor lighting wire route, place the lights where you would like them, then lay out the wires, try to keep the wires near walkways, driveways, and patios or places where a stray shovel won't encounter the wire. Wiring a receptacle so that one half is a typical receptacle and the other half is controlled by a switch is commonly called a split-wired receptacle.</p>

If necessary, remove all the wires but one, check the outlet for power, and then use a different wire.</p>
<p>A professional landscape lighting installation is as important as good design. Note where the white (neutral), black (power), and green or bare copper (ground) wires are attached on the existing outlet. Step 3: Unplug all of the appliances on the circuit whose breaker keeps tripping. Unexpected power failures, blown fuses or damaged electrical equipment could all be electrical emergencies.

There is no project too big or too small for the Rawhide Electrical Services team. If there is a light, the blue wire should be connected to the black wire of the switch as well.

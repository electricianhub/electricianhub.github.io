Wiring a receptacle so that one half is a typical receptacle and the other half is controlled by a switch is commonly called a split-wired receptacle.</p>
<p>One of our electricians can diagnose the source of the problem and provide you with solutions. Loose switches or outlets can look bad, but worse yet, they're dangerous. An electrician will also need to know how much electricity is already available in the room and panel if, for example, you want to have a few new light fixtures installed or put in a new appliance.

You'll now have a circuit breaker that will allow up to 20 amps of electricity to wiring that is only rated to be safe up to 15 amps.</p>
<p>The ground pigtail goes to the green ground screw on the switch.

In other words, if you hadn't had your computer plugged into a surge protector you could well have lost it to a power surge or lightning strike a lot sooner than you did.

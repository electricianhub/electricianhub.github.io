While most people think of lightning strikes and inclement weather causing power surges, most people don't think of the moment the lights come back on after a blackout.</p>

However, if the device is sensitive to fluctuations and performance is sorely affected by fluctuations, you need to hook it up to a surge protector.</p>

Moreover, sufficient egress lighting must be installed at exit accesses, exits, and exit discharges.

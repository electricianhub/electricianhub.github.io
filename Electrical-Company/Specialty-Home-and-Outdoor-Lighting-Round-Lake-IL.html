<p>When you upgrade to a 200 AMP breaker panel, though, you can ensure that your electrical panel box is not only able to handle the power demands of your home but is also much safer. For maximum light output and fixture life, the goal when installing low voltage systems is to provide each lamp with between 10.5 and 11.5 volts.

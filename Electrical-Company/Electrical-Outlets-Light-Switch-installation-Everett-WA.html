Today's homes require at least 150 amps to accommodate most electronics and appliances. To update light fixtures, you generally only need to fit the light devices and switches. Cords under rugs pose a tripping hazard and can overheat, while furniture can crush cord insulation and damage wires. That's why a lot of employers recommend getting some basic electrical training before applying for the apprenticeships that they sponsor. In your switch box you should have one or more grounding conductors spliced together with a wire connector or wire crimp.</p>

In general we'd use 14-2 wire on a 15 amp circuit to power electrical receptacles and a SEPARATE circuit to power the lighting fixtures. We provide electrical contracting services to the Northern Virginia, Stafford, Fredericksburg, and surrounding areas.

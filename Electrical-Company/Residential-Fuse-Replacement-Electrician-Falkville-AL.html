  <meta name="description" content="Low Voltage Lighting & Wiring  Falkville Alabama - I have not tried the drilling machine trick yet, but will doing so most likely before the weekend - I can say that this trick sounds totally logical and correct as when I was still at school and studied Electrical Technology and Auto Electrical principals, we were taught to use a battery, but as I don't have a low current battery ( torch batteries ) on hand without going to buy them specifically for this one time use ( our school always had 6 Volt or 9 Volt lantern batteries on hand for the hands-on class ( referring back to the early 1980's ), I cannot use a standard car battery as the amount of amps the car battery can supply through the low resistance stator coils will burn the stator of rotor coils out instantly.">

Gentec Services has years of electrical experience to answer any and all questions about the right switch and generator for your home. Rewiring or upgrading other electrical components should result in outlet switch upgrades.</p>
<p>There are many reasons why you may want to install or upgrade your outdoor lighting. Again this is just a general rule of thumb for most electrical house wiring. It's easy for the electrical equipment that we see every day to fade into the background, but it's important to always take safety precautions around it. Take time to explain to your kids how to be safe around electricity before they head outdoors. We'll provide prompt, dependable service to ensure that your outdoor lighting system meets your family's needs perfectly.</p>

To pass inspection, a junction box must be installed to encapsulate a 120V AC wire connection to a 12-24V DC power converter (driver). We know that you cannot predict when your electrical system will stop working properly or when you need emergency repairs. We offer emergency electrician services day and night so you can rely on us in any emergency electrical situation at your home.

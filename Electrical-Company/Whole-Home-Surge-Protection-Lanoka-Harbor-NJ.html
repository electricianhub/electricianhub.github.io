It acts as a semi-conductor to divert excess electrical power to a grounding wire. When you pull power from an existing receptacle for a new receptacle, the electrical code requires AFCI protection for both the existing wiring and the new wiring. One example of this sort of lighting is the High line Calo Spot 4 low voltage cable lighting from Bruck Lighting.</p>
<p>Electricians specializing in maintenance fix and upgrade existing electrical systems and repair electrical equipment.

<p>It works a lot like traffic control, wherein it sends electricity to each of your system's circuits. When you're done drilling holes, pull the cable between the boxes and to the service panel to complete the circuit. To figure out exactly where the wires are, you'll look f­or the outlets and appliances that each wire connects to. You'll also figure out which circuit breaker applies to which section of your home's wiring. These devices improve electrical safety by tripping and disconnecting power transmission when the line connecting the electric panel and your appliances becomes overloaded and at risk of heating up and burning.</p>

With Mr. Value Electricians, we always perform an assessment of your home's energy consumption and wiring before every job. In this study, only 33 percent of their firms' revenues, on average, came from new construction. But let's be honest - in the event of the power outage caused by a hurricane or a forest fire, noise is one of the last things you and your neighbors are going to be concerned about (they're probably going to use their own generators too).</p>

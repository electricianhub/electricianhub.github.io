So if you have an old, faulty, or malfunctioning service panel, that does not fulfil its functions properly, you are at risk of burning electronics in your home, suffering a blackout, electrocution, or even electrical fires. If your generator's power output has started to fluctuate, it's a sign of malfunctioning components and possible end of service life.</p>
<p>Depending on total wattage, an inverter generator can be used for many emergency situations during a home power outage. Electricity flows through the hot wire, entering the switch and then into the light fixture, and then returns back through the neutral wire.

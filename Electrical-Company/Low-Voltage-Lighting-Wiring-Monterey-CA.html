<p>We will upgrade the grounding system to the current electrical code. For this reason, the two main terminals are connected to black wires. As mentioned earlier, an engineer can perform a new load calculation allowing the reduction of the main circuit breaker to 150A and allowing you to add an 80A breaker for the PV system in the electrical panel.

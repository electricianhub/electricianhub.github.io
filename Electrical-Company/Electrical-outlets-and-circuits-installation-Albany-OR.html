Turn on your standby generators when there is a power outage and keep your home running smoothly until it is restored. I like to wrap one strip of electricians black tape around my switches and outlets to cover the screws. Check your appliances regularly for faulty switches, plugs and frayed cords.</p>

<p>Upgrading your main service panel is the best way to guarantee that your system won't leave you in the dark when you need it most.

As an unlicensed individual, legally you can't charge for electrician work because you won't be able to pull a permit or schedule an inspection.</p>
<p>We get it, there can be a ton of confusion when it comes to different types of electricians. If the lights and receptacles are wired with a multi-wire circuit than it doesn't matter as both circuits, if wired correctly on the two pole circuit breakers, will shut off anyway. You must still remove the red (or whatever color is switched) wires and splice them together with a wire nut if there is more than one of them. Immediately addressing the problem with your electrical panel will help you avoid emergency situations and potential issues such as power surges, electrical shocks, and circuit overloads.</p>

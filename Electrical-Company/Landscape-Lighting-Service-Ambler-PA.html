<p>Every household should be equipped with a whole house surge protector. Master Electrician - You must show proof of eight years of work experience. An associate degree in electrical technology is perhaps the most popular option for future electricians who choose to attend two-year programs. Once the system detects that you have been disconnected from your utility grid, the generator starts up and transfers its power to the home's electrical panel automatically.

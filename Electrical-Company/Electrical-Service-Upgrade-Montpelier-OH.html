The black (hot) wire goes to the brass screw or into the hole in the back of the device on the same side as the brass screw.</p>
<p>Journeyman Electrician: Completion of a vocational or apprenticeship program. With a switch controlling a receptacle it is possible that one cable, with white, black and ground wires, connects to a receptacle.

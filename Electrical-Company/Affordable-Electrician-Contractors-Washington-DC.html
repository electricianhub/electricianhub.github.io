<p>Permanent home standby generators are your ideal partner in providing solutions to that much needed backup power during electricity outages. Here's MY conundrum… I want to build myself a custom POWER BAR or two, to add outlets into my bench and desk areas. Turn off the mains electricity, and then remove all of the circuits from the panel. But generators come in a range of types, sizes and costs, so you'll want to put a fair amount of thought into this high-involvement purchase.

<p>Your generator will stay more reliable if you are frequently inspecting and performing planned maintenance services at the recommended intervals.

<h2>How To Hire Licensed Electrician Service in Hazard</h2>
<p>Outdoor lighting has many benefits but most importantly it provides homeowners with extra safety and security during night time hours. Breakers Are Tripping - When you have a breaker that's tripping, there's too much power that's flowing through your circuit. In this course, you will learn about the fundamentals of series and parallel circuits as well as how to calculate current, voltage, and resistance in them. The goal of learning about electrical safety is to not become an expert in electricity or electrical repair but to gain enough knowledge to be able to react in an emergency. Set a voltage tester to "Volts" and touch the tip of each tester-wire to a terminal screw at opposite sides of the switch-outlet.</p>

<p>The advantages of halogen are the cost of the fixtures (they are one of the cheapest), and the quality of light. If you notice lights dimming or flickering when a large appliance kicks on, that means they're on the same circuit and the appliance takes electrical current away from the lights when it turns on. Unscrew the switch from the electrical box and pull it out with the wires still attached. These two components work together to maintain constant electrical power for a home or business when there is an outage.</p>
<p>Although they all may look the same when installed, the various light switches function in different ways and are wired differently. You can double check to ensure that it was turned off by flipping the switch in an attempt to operate a light, and by using a voltage tester once the switch plate is removed to confirm that the wires are not charged.

<p>Thank you so much for helping, I found where the main power comes from and it's hooked to the GFI that's next to the switch, so I did a pigtail of the (hot) black wire to the switch and then the other black wire that runs from the outlet from underneath the sink to the other bronze screw on the switch.

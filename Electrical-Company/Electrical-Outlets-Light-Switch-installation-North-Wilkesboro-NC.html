<h2>Electrical Service Upgrade North Wilkesboro North Carolina</h2>
<p>Permanently installed generators run on either natural gas or propane. The size of the generator you need is directly related to the appliances you want to keep power running to. If you just needed a fridge to have power, the size of the generator would be much smaller. Connected to your LP or natural gas fuel supply, the backup generator kicks in within seconds of determining a power loss and can run as long as it takes for your utility power to turn back on.</p>

Older homes may have small electrical panels with minimal loads that may not be able to service high-power, modern appliances. When electrical contractors have a good understanding of what a job involves, they can then make plans on how to proceed. I did look into a generator and remember that all Honda gasoline generators can be made to run on propane with one of these conversion kits.</p>

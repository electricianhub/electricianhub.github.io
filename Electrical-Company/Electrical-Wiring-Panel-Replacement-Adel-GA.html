<p>There is one aspect of electrical panel replacement that few people ever consider, and that's the immense savings you can receive. Old electric panels contain fuses, which can have problems. Because modern homes us a number of energy-hungry appliances, a 200-amp panel is the minimum we'd suggest. We use that information to determine if you need a panel change or an entire service upgrade.

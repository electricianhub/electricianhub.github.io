<p>Before you disconnect the wires from the outlet, make sure that you know which wire was connected to which screw. One of the accessories that comes with these systems is a remote photo control that automatically turn lights on and off during the daytime hours as well as night time.

<p>If the breaker panel in your home is in poor condition, you may end up with no power in your house or worse.

<p>In most jurisdictions, a master electrician license would allow you to bid jobs and offer your services independently to the public. And if you are not sure what a wire is connected to, just turn the breaker off, disconnect the wire and put a wago or a nut at the end of it and turn the circuit back on and see what is not working. After that time you expose yourself to potential electrical dangers by overloading your system with the latest electrical equipment.</p>
<p>A surge protector attempts to limit the voltage supplied to an electric device by either blocking or shorting to ground any unwanted voltages above a safe threshold. In this article series we describe low-voltage wiring, controls, and power supplies operating usually at 24VAC and that in turn are used to control line-voltage devices operating usually at 120VAC or 240VAC.

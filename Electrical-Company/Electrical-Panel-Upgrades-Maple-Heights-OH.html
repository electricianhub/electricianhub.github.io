Troubleshooting variable speed drive (VSD) systems effectively almost always requires in-depth knowledge of the controller, but it also requires broad knowledge of the systems that the drives are often a part of.

Connect the new switch or outlet by connecting the wires to the screw terminals as described above. If you have two-pronged, non-grounded receptacle outlets in your home, you should consider upgrading to three-prong, grounded receptacle outlets.

Even the best surge protector will fail if there is no proper escape route via grounding for excess electricity to go. If your home has grounding issues, have them addressed quickly, as wiring repair or upgrade costs will pale in comparison to replacing fried appliances.</p>
<p>This actually isn't too rare, as outlet junction boxes sometimes serve as junction boxes for other circuits passing through. A switch counts as two wires.

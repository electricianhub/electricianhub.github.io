<h2>How To Hire Licensed Electrician Service in Greenwood</h2>
<p>Siemens is committed to providing high quality surge protective devices for application in residential, commercial, and industrial electrical systems. By utilizing general maintenance on home and business electrical systems, customers can potentially decrease their need for emergency services. Upgrading an electrical service adds value to the home and in some cases, can lower homeowner's insurance premiums.

The use of 12 or 10-gauge main cable increases efficiency and allows you to either place greater loads on your home runs or to use a lower voltage tap, in effect giving you the ability to increase voltage to existing fixtures in the future or to add more fixtures to that run without having to install a new home run cable. When a surge protective device senses a transient voltage spike, it uses internal components called Metal Oxide Varistors (MOVs) that act like magnets for the excess voltage, and sends it to the load center's ground wire before it can reach your home's connected electronics.</p>

To provide the most reliable protection, a whole house surge protection network is needed.

<p>I have a few tips for keeping your landscape lighting wires safe, one tip I'll show you, most do it yourselfers would never think of. When planning your outdoor lighting wire route, place the lights where you would like them, then lay out the wires, try to keep the wires near walkways, driveways, and patios or places where a stray shovel won't encounter the wire. Wiring a receptacle so that one half is a typical receptacle and the other half is controlled by a switch is commonly called a split-wired receptacle.</p>
<p>An electrician reads blueprints to assist in working with electrical systems. Use a flathead screwdriver to remove the switch cover, and a Phillips head screwdriver to remove the existing switch from the box. If qualified, you may also submit an application for examination for the following licenses issued by the Bureau of Construction Codes, Electrical Division.

Unless your outlets are switched, with a switch somewhere in the kitchen, (that would be very unusual), each outlet appears to have 2 circuits going to it. Verify this if possible, by turning off the breakers. Turn the power back on and make sure that the outlet works properly by plugging in a lamp and checking to see that the light switch turns the lamp on and off.</p>

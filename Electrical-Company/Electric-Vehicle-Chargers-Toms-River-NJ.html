It is possible, and you can turn the power off and pull the outlet out of the box to see what is there, but if there are no other wires but those terminated on the outlet you would have to run another wire from the switch to the outlet. Knowing how long the job will take, and how many people will work with the electrician is essential.</p>

Homes are wired in this manner, if you have ever replaced a light fixture, you would have noticed the wires are twisted together then capped with a wire nut, I also use this method when repairing automotive wiring, it makes a great connection, and it's permanent.

<p>With an increased reliance on both data collection and machinery run by computer software, electrical maintenance is more vital than ever. Lighten up your place with right light fixtures. Your project actually begins at the electrical supply panel, which is also commonly referred to as a breaker box or fuse box. A whole house generator should be placed in a place that is easy to access for repair and maintenance.

<p>If a fuse blows, turn off all appliances and lights that are on the circuit before changing the fuse. For instance, a good quality surge protector meant for home theater use will also give you the advantage of regulating the electricity bill.

Your Generac generator runs on your existing natural gas or liquid propane fuel supply.</p>
<p>To access the wiring, gently pull the switches out of the electrical boxes. People often think of power strips when they hear "surge protection". Check electric cords often for damage.

<p>Electrical surges are a nightmare for everyone. Our team of electricians is licensed to provide quality care for the safety of your family, property and belongings.

The controller is faulty if there are no voltmeter readings on all three of the terminal pairs. The generator is paired with a transfer switch containing a predetermined number of circuits based on the generator's kW power rating. Damaged power cords are a serious residential electrical safety risk, and they are capable of causing both fires and electrocution.</p>
<p>Light fixtures are usually placed 10 feet from the transformer and each other. We tend to forget that cables, switches, socket-outlets and other equipment can get worn over time and that it is important to get them regularly checked and, if necessary, replaced by a qualified electrician.

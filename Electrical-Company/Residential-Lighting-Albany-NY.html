<p>The easiest way to do this is to install an AFCI receptacle at the first receptacle outlet of the existing circuit. Standby generators can run on natural gas or propane. A transient surge protector attempts to limit the voltage supplied to an electric device by either blocking or shorting current to reduce the voltage below a safe threshold.

If you have electronics plugged into power strips, make sure they have surge protection as well (not all power strips do!).

Upgrading your home's electrical service could mean only upgrading your electrical panel, or it could mean upgrading your home's wiring system as well.</p>

Knowing how to run a successful electrical business includes knowing how big, or small, your business should be. The Goldilocks principle” applies here — not too hot, not too cold … not too big, not too small.

<p>However, the electrician also needs to know beforehand exactly which switch is directly linked to the specific light fixture to be replaced. Its diminutive structure, however, does not mean that its surge protection capabilities have been compromised. Simply plug a Switcheroo into your switched outlet, and then another Switcheroo into as many outlets that you want to turn on and off with your existing switch.

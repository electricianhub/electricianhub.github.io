This makes them much more common for large-scale outdoor projects, including landscape lighting projects. Indoor reduced voltage lighting is also very affordable and convenient to use. If you can't get the transformer close enough to your light fixtures you will need to up the voltage that your line carries. Worn cords and damaged plugs increase your risk of both fires and electrical shocks.</p>

Once a location is selected, solar garden lights also can be relocated with ease by simply removing the mount and reinserting into another location. While there is certainly work enough for electrical contractors and energy experts overall, the business model of the contractor is increasingly challenged.</p>

If it was you have two circuits in each box and outlet, and very likely have 240 volts in the outlet boxes, which is OK but any such box (and outlet) needs labeled indicating that. This should also include any trees, garden decor, or special features of the landscaping Taking measurements will also help when it comes time to purchase the lighting fixtures, particularly if you are going to use low voltage lighting, because you need to have the right amount of cabling for the entire project.</p>

<p>Most generator sets are designed for off-road use and are capable of running with the use of 'construction grade' diesel which is usually a more cost effective fuel. The transfer switch has a NEMA 3R enclosure that allows for both indoor and outdoor installation. In order to work unsupervised, an electrical worker must be a licensed electrician. Many older homes and service buildings are not adequately wired to serve today's electrical loads. The move towards electronics and modern technology, particularly in the defence sector, was a departure from the domestic electrical goods market.</p>

<p>The advantages of halogen are the cost of the fixtures (they are one of the cheapest), and the quality of light.

Unscrew the switch from the electrical box and pull it out with the wires still attached. These two components work together to maintain constant electrical power for a home or business when there is an outage.</p>

However, there are electrician licensing requirements at the local level so make sure to check these before you begin to work. Normal Voltage (120V) wiring: "normal" building electrical wires, typically #14 gauge (for 15-Amp circuits), is used to carry electrical power into and then out of the low-voltage relay and on to the light, electrical receptacle, or other device that the switch and relay are intended to control.</p>

<p>This creates a loose connection, and loose connections cause the wires in outlets to burn up and kill the rest of the circuit. But instead the connection points (The places where the wire connects to any switches, receptacles, junction boxes, panels, and more). Typically a quality home surge protector will have three or more MOVs lined up in a row to expand the capabilities of the unit. Working conditions for electricians vary by specialization. Turn the light switch on, and the power to the outlet is on, turn it off, and the power is off.</p>
<p>This is one of the reasons you don't just want a surge protector at the circuit panel A layered system will be connected directly to the electrical panel and at the point of use. Unless your outlets are switched, with a switch somewhere in the kitchen, (that would be very unusual), each outlet appears to have 2 circuits going to it. Verify this if possible, by turning off the breakers. Turn the power back on and make sure that the outlet works properly by plugging in a lamp and checking to see that the light switch turns the lamp on and off.</p>

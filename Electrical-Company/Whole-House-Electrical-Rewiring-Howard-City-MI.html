The resulting surge, which lasts a few microseconds, can destroy electronic components such as memory, processors, capacitors, and screens.</p>
<p>Over time, however, panels can age, and their components wear out, which will necessitate repairs. You will also need a firm understanding of Ohms law (Volt x Amps = Watts) and how it works in relation to laying out the wiring for the lighting system.

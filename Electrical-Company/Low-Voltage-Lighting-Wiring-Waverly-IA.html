When you use a generator as an emergency power source in your home, you need to know the number of a reliable electrician if your unit stops working.</p>
<p>Depending on total wattage, an inverter generator can be used for many emergency situations during a home power outage. Electricity flows through the hot wire, entering the switch and then into the light fixture, and then returns back through the neutral wire. A power surge will travel through any wire into a house, leaving common appliances and sensitive electronic equipment vulnerable to serious damage. This approach is general in nature allowing it to be used on any type of electrical circuit.</p>
<p>Look in the fuse box or breaker box and see what rating the fuse is set at, look on the outer sheathing on the wire and see what its rating is. If you are continually resetting breakers or replacing fuses then there is likely to be a fault and more current is trying to be drawn than the circuit is designed for. It is best to let our team of professional electricians install your LED recessed lights because we are aware of local building codes that may pertain to the installation work.</p>

Normal Voltage (120V) wiring: "normal" building electrical wires, typically #14 gauge (for 15-Amp circuits), is used to carry electrical power into and then out of the low-voltage relay and on to the light, electrical receptacle, or other device that the switch and relay are intended to control.</p>
<p>One of the first decisions you'll have to make it whether you want lights that are solar-powered or wired for electricity. Loop the far end of the wire back to the transformer to ensure both ends of the loop are powered, which also prevents the lights from going out if the wire is broken somewhere along its length, McGowan adds.

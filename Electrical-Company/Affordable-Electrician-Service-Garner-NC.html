For commercial installs, we can set the generators to send diagnostic information to the IT department or another internal department via email or text. But to properly understand the full benefits of low voltage lighting, we should start here: low voltage lighting is more of a tactical application than a budgetary or energy-saving one, though there may be moderate gains in these areas in certain instances.</p>

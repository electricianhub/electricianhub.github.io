<p>Electricians may need to take classes to learn about changes to the National Electrical Code, and they often complete regular safety programs, manufacturer-specific training, and management training courses. A joule rating of at least 600 should be able to handle most household surges. Important note: NEVER increase the size of a panel breaker on a circuit that keeps tripping.

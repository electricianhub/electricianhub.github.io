<p>That's why we recommend yearly inspections to troubleshoot and prevent issues before they start, or repair or replace the electrical panel if needed. Go ahead and give us a call today and will be able to help you through any of the problems you are having with your electrical wiring systems. Be absolutely certain before testing your generator you have turned off the circuit breakers in the main panel to your AC. Failure to do can result in a electrical fire causing damage to the generator and house.</p>
<p>You can access these circuit breakers and turn them on and off to restrict power to a particular circuit in your home. On the other hand, a generator that's too powerful for what you need will cost more to install and operate. Knowing how to run a successful electrical business includes knowing how big, or small, your business should be. The Goldilocks principle‚Äù applies here ‚Äî not too hot, not too cold ‚Ä¶ not too big, not too small.

Once public power is restored, your generator will automatically disengage, ready to work for you the next time it's needed.

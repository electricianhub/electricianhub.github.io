Lights flickering, warm to the touch receptacles, and any noticeable odor such as, the smell of burning plastic should be inspected by a licensed electrician.

A more recent addition to the homeowner electrical safety checklist is tamper-resistant outlets. So, if your fixtures are each eighteen watts and you have ten of them, that is 180 watts for your transformer and 25% more for the wire.</p>

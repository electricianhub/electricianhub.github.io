<p>We are a home electrical company that offers electrical light switch and outlet installation services in areas of New Jersey such as Howell, Princeton, Trenton, Freehold, Middletown, Manalapan, and Elizabeth.

<p>The price varies to install a light switch , depending on how complex the switch is. For example, a single-pole switch requiring no rewiring will cost about $75, while a smart switch requiring new wiring may cost as much as $250. Because an electrical problem detected in its infancy typically allows companies a larger window of time to schedule repair before the problem gets worse, scans makes it easier to schedule repairs in terms of both cost planning and weekly business scheduling.</p>

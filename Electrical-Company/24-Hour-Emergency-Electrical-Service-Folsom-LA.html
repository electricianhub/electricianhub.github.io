Once you have decided the types of effects you want in each area of your yard you will be much more prepared to find the right kind of fixtures. To obtain a Michigan journey electrician license, a person must meet the requirements and pass the journey electrician license examination.</p>

At Epic Electrical, we are also proud to service and install LED lighting. More isn't always better with LED landscape lighting.

Most states require electricians to pass a test and be licensed. In all events, regardless of which connection point you are using, receptacles and switches have a designated side or screw or connector set for the white (neutral wire) (typically the side that has a silver colored screw and that is marked NEUTRAL on the device) and for the black (hot wire) (typically the side that has a brass-colored screwed and is marked LINE or HOT or BLACKI).</p>

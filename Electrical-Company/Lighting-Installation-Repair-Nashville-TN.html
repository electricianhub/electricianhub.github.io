<p>People spend lots of money on home electronics devices like home theater systems, audiovisual systems, computers and other devices. If you simply cut the wire in the outlet box, it is not a neutral, just a wire covered with white insulation. The reason might be a neighborhood power outage or a natural disaster, including hurricanes and storms. Generator installations, repairs, service, sales & rentals.

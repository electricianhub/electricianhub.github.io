Class B Electrician: Must complete 3,000 hours of work in residential or farmstead wiring in 1 to 2-family dwellings under a Class B or Master electrician. Finally, as with all electrical or mechanical devices, wear and tear, age and the effects of the elements can create damage that requires repair or replacement.

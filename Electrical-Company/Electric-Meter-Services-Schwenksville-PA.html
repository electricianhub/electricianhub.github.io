Get an electrical engineer to estimate how much amperage you need to add before planning to install central heat and air or new appliances such as an electric range, a dryer, and others, which use 240-volt power.

Instead of a single receptacle that has been split-wired to feed from two different circuits (usually using a common neutral and properly wired in the panel etc), you often see a 4" box with a pair of receptacles that side by side are run from different circuits instead of up and down different circuits in the same box. Be sure to include all landscape features, buildings, individual light fixtures, and power supplies in your drawing.</p>

Start by taking off the switch plate by removing the two screws that secure it to the light switch.</p>

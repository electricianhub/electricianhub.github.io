If you need assistance with your smoke or carbon monoxide systems call the licensed electricians at Stack Electric. 6,000-volt surge protection guards against power irregularities that can be a hazard to LED landscape lighting. 3 Independent Electrical Contractors (IEC) is another trade association for electrical contractors with 70 chapters across the U.S. They provide education and training via a U.S. Department of Labor recognized apprenticeship program.</p>

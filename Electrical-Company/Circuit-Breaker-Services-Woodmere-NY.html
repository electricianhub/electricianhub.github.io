<p>There are supposedly various reasons behind this light installation problem. Older appliances could have grounding issues that might put you at risk for a shock.

The result of a properly installed system is a beautifully illuminated landscape and a safe installation.

Circuit Breaker: These GFCI outlets protect and entire circuit board rather than a single outlet. Electrical licenses are not awarded at the state level in New York.

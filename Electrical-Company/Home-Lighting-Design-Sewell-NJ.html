Whereas a portable generator can only run a few of your electrical devices, a standby generator has enough juice to power your entire home - this includes your lights, appliances, and even entertainment devices.</p>

You must have at least 12,000 hours of on-the-job training under the supervision of a master electrician.</p>
<p>For each year of the program, apprentices typically receive 2,000 hours of paid on-the-job training as well as some classroom instruction. Keep extension cords away from heat, water and oil. There is never a convenient time for the residents of Bellevue, WA to experience an electrical problem in their home. Replace older extension cords if one of the prongs in the plug is not polarized.” In a polarized plug, one prong will be wider than the other. At 120v, less current, measured in amps, is required to provide the wattage needed for home lights and appliances.</p>

Old fuse boxes were never designed to handle the electrical load we now require from our homes.

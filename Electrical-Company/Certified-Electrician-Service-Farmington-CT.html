We offer reliable and affordable lighting fixture repairs and installations in New Jersey in areas such as Middletown, Howell, Trenton, Elizabeth, Tom's River, and Old Bridge.</p>

The preferred light fittings used to create most lighting designs, are low voltage, weather resistant fixtures. The system will trip when you plug too many appliances into a circuit which requires more power than the circuit can accommodate. They take time in triggering and permitting higher voltage spikes to exist before they conduct a significant current.</p>
<p>The two top lugs of the meter are where the power lines connect, which means there is high voltage at a lethal level coming into the service panel. Although not as powerful as some other home standby generators, the Generac is certainly not a unit that can't be relied on for power and durability.

<p>Standby generators are what you choose when you don't even want to know that a power outage is occurring. 3.Circuits can be added for future power needs due to proposed home renovations. A home backup generator delivers power directly to your home's electrical system, backing up your entire home or just the most essential items. Power cords should not be stapled into place or run under rugs and furniture. Most LED lights require 12-volt DC volt transformers while most incandescent lights require 12-volt AC transformers.</p>

<p>We also offer highly reliable surge protection devices that help protect vulnerable equipment against the adverse effects produced by voltage spikes.

Generator installations and repairs should only be handled by a certified contractor.</p>
<p>The ground wire goes to the green ground screw on the outlet, the white wire goes to a silver screw, the black wire to one of the brass screws, and the red wire to the other brass screw.

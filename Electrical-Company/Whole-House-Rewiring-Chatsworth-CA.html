Landscape Lighting Pro of Utah offers annual service programs that ensure your outdoor lighting system operates at optimum levels throughout the year. US Patent 7,876,066: Multi-component charging station with surge protector by Kenneth Mori and Yoko Iida, Belkin International, Inc., January 25, 2011.</p>

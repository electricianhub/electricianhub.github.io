<h2>How To Hire Residential Electrician in Warrington</h2>
<p>In order to wire your own home, you must comply with the requirements of the 2017 edition of the National Electrical Code (NEC). The first rubber-insulated cables for US building wiring were introduced in 1922 with US patent 1458803 , Burley, Harry & Rooney, Henry, "Insulated electric wire", issued 1923-06-12, assigned to Boston Insulated Wire And Cable citation needed These were two or more solid copper electrical wires with rubber insulation, plus woven cotton cloth over each conductor for protection of the insulation, with an overall woven jacket, usually impregnated with tar as a protection from moisture.</p>

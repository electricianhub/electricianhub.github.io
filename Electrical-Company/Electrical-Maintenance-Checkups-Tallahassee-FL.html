On the other hand, a generator that's too powerful for what you need will cost more to install and operate. Knowing how to run a successful electrical business includes knowing how big, or small, your business should be. The Goldilocks principle‚Äù applies here ‚Äî not too hot, not too cold ‚Ä¶ not too big, not too small.

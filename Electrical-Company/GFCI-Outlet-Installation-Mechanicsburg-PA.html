Rough-in - This is when you have all of the boxes mounted, all wires installed to all of the boxes and properly stapled, supported and exposed for inspection (with no insulation, drywall or other material covering the wiring).</p>
<p>Lighting can hide obvious landscape problems while accentuating positive features. They use different types of hand and power tools, such as conduit benders, to run and protect wiring.

<p>Most homeowners know how to reset a circuit breaker that trips, but few people besides electricians give the industrial grey box in the garage or laundry room much thought until the lights go out. For as long as the surge voltage lasts, the semiconductor channels harmful current to ground. Ambient light from the spotlights you do use can also illuminate and create an interplay of light and shadow of nearby plants and foliage. Most transformers are rated to handle a load of 100 to 300 watts; the higher the rating, the longer the cable—and thus the more light fixtures—you can connect to the system.</p>

<p>Some of the major considerations include where you'll set up a portable generator, how and where to ground the generator, how you'll protect the generator from the elements and where you can safely store your fuel reserves. Then lay the wire round the complete area you are installing your fixtures. To determine the right home low-voltage transformer, add the wattage of all fixtures to be added to the circuit.

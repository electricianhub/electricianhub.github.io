<p>After completing an apprenticeship program, electricians are considered to be journey workers and may perform duties on their own, subject to any local licensing requirements. To stay safe - make sure you always turn off the circuit breaker or remove proper fuses before tackling a this sort of home improvement project or when replacing a piece of electrical equipment. These types of boxes are a heck of a lot easier to install before the drywall is up, so even if there's a small chance that you'll replace the light with a fan sometime down the road, avoid headaches and spend a couple extra bucks on a fan box.</p>
<p>Have the lighting professional take care of making these adjustments for you, and leave the programming instructions with you. Now use a square-blade shovel to cut a 2- to 3-inch-deep trench along the line where you want the light fixtures. Condition of existing wiring and fixtures. However, if you experience frequent breaker trips or dimming lights, it may mean your electrical panel can't handle the load and is due for an upgrade. Our electricians always put your needs first, so we guarantee 100% satisfaction.</p>

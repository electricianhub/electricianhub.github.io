However, today's electricians , electrical engineers and linemen are extensively trained to provide the safest possible service. Replace any two-pronged outlets with newer, grounded three-pronged outlets. If the power originates in the switch box then you will have to install additional wire because that black wire is switched and you need both that and a constant hot wire.</p>

Outdoor solar lights are a little more expensive to purchase but they are much easier to install.

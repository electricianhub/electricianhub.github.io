<p>Electricity problems at home can be quite unnerving and it can be frustrating when it occurs at midnight especially in summers. The electrical wiring in a home service panel can be confusing when taking the DIY approach, and an improperly installed device could result in defects or danger to those installing it. The home surge protector may not function properly if not installed correctly and at worse, could cause more damage. When there is a surge, the extra voltage is diverted to the grounding wire inside the surge protector.

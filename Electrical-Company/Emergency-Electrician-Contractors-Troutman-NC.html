Once that first outlet was done, I turned my attention to a troublesome outlet that was giving a hot and neutral reversed” fault code. While they can be ineffective against direct lightning strikes, a quality surge protector can stop most strong power surges and prevent them from damaging the gear that's plugged into them. An amp is the amount of electrical current that flows through a circuit.</p>
<p>Additionally, portable generators can only be used safely outdoors or in a well-ventilated area away from a house or garage as they give off very toxic, deadly and odorless carbon monoxide.

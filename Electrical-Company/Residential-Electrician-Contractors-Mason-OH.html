<p>This course is intended to provide electrical maintenance students with a basic background in transformer theory and connection schemes, as well as provide an overview of the most common transformer types and the typical maintenance and testing procedures that apply to them.

<p>Solar outdoor lights are probably the most popular type of outdoor lighting available on the market. If necessary, cut the sod around the light fixtures with the shovel.

After that time you expose yourself to potential electrical dangers by overloading your system with the latest electrical equipment.</p>
